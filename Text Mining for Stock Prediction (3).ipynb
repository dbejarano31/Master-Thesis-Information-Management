Before deciding whether to invest in our common stock, you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below. You should also consider the risks, uncertainties and assumptions discussed under the heading “Risk Factors” included in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, as revised or supplemented by our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q, each of which are on file with the SEC and are incorporated herein by reference, and which may be amended, supplemented or superseded from time to time by other reports we file with the SEC in the future. There may be other unknown or unpredictable economic, business, competitive, regulatory or other factors that could have material adverse effects on our future results. If any of these risks actually occurs, our business, business prospects, financial condition or results of operations could be seriously harmed. This could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline, resulting in a loss of all or part of your investment. Please also read carefully the section below entitled “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.” Risks Related to This Offering and Our Common StockWe will have broad discretion in the use of the net proceeds from this offering and may not use them effectively.We currently intend to use the net proceeds of this offering for working capital and general corporate purposes, as further described in the section of this prospectus supplement entitled “Use of Proceeds.” We will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds and investors will be relying on the judgment of our management regarding the application of the proceeds of this offering. The failure by our management to apply these funds effectively could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Pending their use, we may invest the net proceeds from this offering in interest-bearing instruments. These investments may not yield a favorable return, or any return, to us or our stockholders.You may experience immediate and substantial dilution.The offering price per share in this offering may exceed the net tangible book value per share of our common stock outstanding prior to this offering. Assuming that an aggregate of 4,030,400 shares of our common stock are sold during the term of the Equity Distribution Agreement with the Sales Agents at a price of $43.42 per share, the last reported sale price of our common stock on Nasdaq on November 18, 2020, for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $175.0 million, after deducting commissions and estimated aggregate offering expenses payable by us, you will experience immediate dilution of $30.38 per share, representing the difference between the assumed offering price and our as adjusted net tangible book value per share as of September 30, 2020 after giving effect to this offering. The exercise of outstanding stock options and vesting of other stock awards may result in further dilution of your investment. See the section entitled “Dilution” appearing elsewhere in this prospectus supplement for a more detailed illustration of the dilution you would incur if you participate in this offering.The actual number of shares we will issue under the Equity Distribution Agreement with the Sales Agents, at any one time or in total, is uncertain.Subject to certain limitations in the Equity Distribution Agreement with the Sales Agents and compliance with applicable law, we have the discretion to deliver placement notices to the Sales Agents at any time throughout the term of the Equity Distribution Agreement. The number of shares that are sold by the Sales Agents after delivering a placement notice may fluctuate based on the market price of the common stock during the sales period and limits we set with the Sales Agents.You may experience future dilution as a result of future equity offerings.In order to raise additional capital, we may in the future offer additional shares of our common stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock at prices that may not be the same as the price per share in this offering. We may sell shares or other securities in any other offering at a price per share that is less than the price per share paid by investors in this offering, and investors purchasing shares or other securities in the future could have rights superior to existing stockholders. The price per share at which we sell additional shares of our common stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into common stock, in future transactions may be higher or lower than the price per share paid by investors in this offering.We do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock, so any returns will be limited to the value of our common stock. We currently anticipate that we will retain any future earnings to finance the continued development, operation and expansion of our business. As a result, we do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends or other distributions in the foreseeable future. Further, if we were to enter into a credit facility or issue debt securities or preferred stock in the future, we may become contractually restricted from paying dividends. If we do not pay dividends, our common stock may be less valuable because stockholders must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, to realize any gains on their investment. The sale of our common stock in this offering and any future sales of our common stock may depress our stock price and our ability to raise funds in new stock offerings.Sales of our common stock in this offering and the public market following this offering could lower the market price of our common stock. Sales may also make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that our management deems acceptable, or at all. Investingin our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties and all other informationcontained in or incorporated by reference into this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus, including the risksand uncertainties described below and under the caption “Risk Factors” in the accompanying prospectus and in our mostrecently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Report on 10-Q filed with the SEC, in each case as these risk factorsare amended or supplemented by subsequent Annual Reports on Form 10-K or Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q that have been or willbe incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement, including any amendments thereto. The risks set forth below and incorporatedherein by reference are those which we believe are the material risks that we face. The occurrence of any of such risks may materiallyand adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects. In such an event, the marketprice of our common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.RisksRelated to this Offering, our Developing Growth Strategy, and Ownership of Our Common Stock Purchasersin the offering will suffer immediate dilution.If you purchase common stock in this offering, the value ofyour shares based on our actual book value will immediately be less than the offering price you paid. This reduction in the valueof your equity is known as dilution. At the public offering price of $13.25 per share, purchasers of common stock in this offeringwill experience immediate dilution of approximately $12.06 per share. Based upon the as adjusted net tangible book value of ourcommon stock at September 30, 2020 (as adjusted for certain issuances that occurred after such date), your shares may be worthless per share than the price you paid in the offering. See “Dilution.” If the options, warrants and convertible securitieswe previously granted are exercised, additional dilution will occur. As of November 17, 2020, options and deferred stock unitsto purchase 3,426,459 shares of common stock at a weighted-average exercise price of $3.66 per share were outstanding and warrantsto purchase 1,301,979 shares of common stock at a weighted-average exercise price of $2.46 per share were outstanding. Furthermore,if we raise additional funding by issuing additional equity securities, the newly-issued shares will further dilute your percentageownership of our shares and may also reduce the value of your investment.S-4Thenotes to our financials for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 include an explanatory paragraph expressing substantialdoubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.Thenotes accompanying our December 31, 2019 and 2018 audited financial statements contain an explanatory paragraph expressing substantialdoubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K were prepared“assuming that we will continue as a going concern.” Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependenton raising additional capital to fund our operations and ultimately on generating future profitable operations. There can be noassurance that we will be able to raise sufficient additional capital or eventually have positive cash flow from operations toaddress all of our cash flow needs. If we are not able to find alternative sources of cash, or generate positive cash flow fromoperations, our operations, business and shareholders may be materially and adversely affected.Wemay be required to raise additional financing by issuing new securities with terms or rights superior to those of our existingshareholders, or at a price per share that is less than the price per share paid by investors in this offering, which could adverselyaffect the market price of shares of our common stock and our business.Wewill require additional financing to fund future operations, including our research, development, sales and marketing activities.We may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms, if at all. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities,we may sell shares or other securities in any other offering at a price per share that is less than the price per share paid byinvestors in this offering. Additionally, if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, the percentage ownershipof our current shareholders will be reduced, and, if the equity securities issued are preferred shares, the holders of the newpreferred shares may have rights superior to those of our existing securityholders, which could adversely affect rights of ourexisting securityholders and the market price of our common stock. If we raise additional funds by issuing debt securities, theholders of those debt securities would have some rights senior to those of our existing securityholders, and the terms of thesedebt securities could impose restrictions on operations and create a significant interest expense for us which could have a materiallyadverse effect on our business.Ourshare price may be volatile, which could subject us to securities class action litigation and prevent you from being able to sellyour shares at or above the offering price.Ourstock could be subject to wide fluctuation in response to many risk factors listed in this section or incorporated by referenceinto this prospectus, and others beyond our control, including:●Market                                         acceptance and commercialization of our products;●Our                                         being able to timely demonstrate achievement of milestones, including those related to                                         revenue generation, cost control, cost effective source supply and regulatory approvals;●Regulatory                                         developments or enforcements in the United States and non-U.S. countries with respect                                         to our products or our competitors’ products;●Failure                                         to achieve pricing acceptable to the market;●Actual                                         or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results, or our                                         continuing to sustain operating losses;●Competition                                         from existing products or new products that may emerge;●Announcements                                         by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures,                                         collaborations or capital commitments;●Issuance                                         of new or updated research or reports by securities analysts;S-5●Announcement                                         or expectation of additional financing efforts, particularly if our cash available for                                         operations significantly decreases;●Fluctuations                                         in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;●Share                                         price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our                                         shares;●Additions                                         or departures of key management personnel;●Disputes                                         or other developments related to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters                                         and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;●Entry                                         by us into any material litigation or other proceedings;●Sales                                         of our common stock by us, our insiders, or our other shareholders;●Market                                         conditions for stocks in general; and●General                                         economic and market conditions unrelated to our performance.Furthermore,the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the marketprices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operatingperformance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political, and marketconditions such as recessions, interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations, may negatively impact the marketprice of shares of our common stock. In addition, such fluctuations could subject us to securities class action litigation, whichcould result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention from other business concerns, which could seriouslyharm our business. If the market price of shares of our common stock after this offering does not exceed the initial public offeringprice, you may not realize any return on your investment in us and may lose some or all of your investment.Ifsecurities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, ourstock price and trading volume could decline.Thetrading market for our common stock is impacted by the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish aboutus or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. We cannot assure that analysts will continue to cover us orprovide favorable coverage. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or change their opinion of our stock,our share price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reportson us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.Managementwill have broad discretion as to the use of the proceeds from this offering and may not use the proceeds effectively.Ourmanagement will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds from this offering and could spend the proceeds inways that may not improve our results of operations or enhance the value of our securities. Our failure to apply these funds effectivelycould have a material adverse effect on our business and cause the price of our common stock to decline.Futuresales, or the possibility of future sales, of a substantial number of shares of our common stock could adversely affect the priceof the shares and dilute shareholders.Futuresales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock, or the perception that such sales will occur, could cause a declinein the market price of our common stock. This is particularly true if we sell our stock at a discount. If, after the end of suchlock-up agreements, these shareholders sell substantial amounts of common stock in the public market, or the market perceivesthat such sales may occur, the market price of our common stock and our ability to raise capital through an issue of equity securitiesin the future could be adversely affected.Inaddition, in the future, we may issue additional shares of common stock or other equity or debt securities convertible into commonstock in connection with a financing, acquisition, litigation settlement, employee arrangements or otherwise. Any such issuancecould result in substantial dilution to our existing shareholders and could cause our common share price to decline.S-6Wehave not paid cash dividends in the past and do not expect to pay dividends in the future. Any return on investment may be limitedto the value of our common stock.Wehave never paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividendson our common stock will depend on earnings, financial condition and other business and economic factors affecting us at suchtime as our board of directors may consider relevant. If we do not pay dividends, our common stock may be less valuable becausea return on your investment will only occur if our stock price appreciates.Weare an “emerging growth company” as that term is used in the JOBS Act, and we intend to continue to take advantageof reduced disclosure and governance requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, which could result in our common stockbeing less attractive to investors and adversely affect the market price of our common stock or make it more difficult to raisecapital as and when we need it.Weare an “emerging growth company” as that term is used in the JOBS Act, and we intend to continue to take advantageof certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerginggrowth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxystatements, exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approvalof any golden parachute payments not previously approved, and exemptions from any rules that the Public Company Accounting OversightBoard may adopt requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report on the financial statements.We currently take advantage of some, but not all, of the reduced regulatory and reporting requirements that are available to usunder the JOBS Act, and intend to continue to do so as long as we qualify as an “emerging growth company.” For example,so long as we qualify as an “emerging growth company,” we may elect not to provide you with certain information, includingcertain financial information and certain information regarding compensation of our executive officers, that we would have otherwisebeen required to provide in filings we make with the SEC, which may make it more difficult for investors and securities analyststo evaluate us.Wecannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investorsfind our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stockprice may be more volatile. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company,which in certain circumstances could be for up to five years. See “Prospectus Supplement Summary — Implications ofBeing an Emerging Growth Company.”Becauseof the exemptions from various reporting requirements provided to us as an “emerging growth company,” we may be lessattractive to investors and it may be difficult for us to raise additional capital as and when we need it. Investors may be unableto compare our business with other companies in our industry if they believe that our financial accounting is not as transparentas other companies in our industry. If we are unable to raise additional capital as and when we need it, our business, resultsof operations, financial condition and cash flows, and future prospects may be materially and adversely affected.S-7CAUTIONARYNOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSThisprospectus supplement contains “forward-looking statements.” Forward-looking statements include, but are not limitedto, statements that express our intentions, beliefs, expectations, strategies, predictions or any other statements relating toour future activities or other future events or conditions. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates andprojections about our business based, in part, on assumptions made by management. These statements are not guarantees of futureperformance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and resultsmay, and are likely to, differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements due to numerousfactors discussed from time to time in this prospectus and in other documents which we file with the SEC. In addition, such statementscould be affected by risks and uncertainties related to:●our    ability to identify financing sources to fund our capital expenditure requirements and continue operations until sufficient    cash flow can be generated from operations;●our    ability to effectively execute our business plan and growth strategy;●unforeseen    or recurring operational problems at our facility, or a catastrophic loss of our manufacturing facility, including the temporary closure of our facility due to COVID-19;●our    dependence on our suppliers, whose ability to supply us may be negatively impacted by the measures being implemented to address    COVID-19;●the    volatility of our stock price;●changes    in consumer demand for, and acceptance of, our products;●overall    strength and stability of general economic conditions and of the automotive industry more specifically, both in the United    States and globally;●changes    in U.S. and foreign trade policy, including the imposition of tariffs and the resulting consequences;●changes    in the competitive environment, including adoption of technologies and products that compete with our products;●our    ability to generate consistent revenues;●our    ability to design, produce and market our vehicles within projected timeframes given that a vehicle consists of several thousand    unique items and we can only go as fast as the slowest item;●our    inexperience to date in manufacturing vehicles at the high volumes that we anticipate;●our    reliance on key personnel;●changes    in the price of oil and electricity;●changes    in laws or regulations governing our business and operations;●our    ability to maintain adequate liquidity and financing sources and an appropriate level of debt, if any, on terms favorable    to our company;●the    number of reservations and cancellations for our vehicles and our ability to deliver on those reservations;●our    ability to maintain quality control over our vehicles and avoid material vehicle recalls;●our    ability to manage the distribution channels for our products, including our ability to successfully implement our direct to    consumer distribution strategy and any additional distribution strategies we may deem appropriate;●our    ability to obtain and protect our existing intellectual property protections including patents;●changes    in accounting principles, or their application or interpretation, and our ability to make estimates and the assumptions underlying    the estimates, which could have an effect on earnings or losses;●interest    rates and the credit markets;●our    ability to maintain our Nasdaq Capital Market listing;●costs    and risks associated with litigation; and●other    risks described from time to time in periodic and current reports that we file with the SEC.Youshould read this prospectus supplement, the accompanying prospectus and the documents that we incorporate by reference hereinand therein completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we currentlyexpect. You should assume that the information appearing in this prospectus supplement, the accompanying prospectus and any documentincorporated by reference herein and therein is accurate as of its date only. Because the risks referred to above could causeactual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf,you should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. Further, any forward-looking statement speaks only as ofthe date on which it is made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstancesafter the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. New factors emerge from timeto time, and it is not possible for us to predict which factors may arise. In addition, we cannot assess the impact of each factoron our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially fromthose contained in any forward-looking statements. We qualify all of the information presented in this prospectus supplement,the accompanying prospectus, any other prospectus supplement and any document incorporated herein or therein by reference, andparticularly our forward-looking statements, by these cautionary statements.S-8USEOF PROCEEDSWe estimate that the net proceeds from the sale of the sharesof common stock that we are offering will be approximately $14.1 million, after deducting the placement agent fees and estimatedoffering expenses payable by us.We intend to use the net proceeds from the sale of our commonstock under this prospectus supplement for general corporate purposes, including to cover our operating expenses and inventory.Theamounts and timing of our use of the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes will depend on a number offactors, such as the timing and progress of our research and development efforts and the timing and progress of any collaborativeor strategic partnering efforts. As of the date of this prospectus supplement, we cannot specify with certainty all of the particularuses for the net proceeds to us from this offering. Accordingly, our management will have broad discretion in the timing and applicationof these proceeds.DIVIDENDPOLICYWehave never declared dividends on our equity securities, and currently do not plan to declare dividends on shares of our commonstock in the foreseeable future. We expect to retain our future earnings, if any, for use in the operation and expansion of ourbusiness. The payment of cash dividends in the future, if any, will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will dependupon such factors as earnings levels, capital requirements, our overall financial condition and any other factors deemed relevantby our Board of Directors.Accordingly, you may need to sell your shares of our commonstock to realize a return on your investment, and you may not be able to sell your shares at or above the price you paid for them.See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to this Offering, Our Developing Growth Strategy, and Ownership of Our Common Stock—Wehave not paid cash dividends in the past and do not expect to pay dividends in the future. Any return on investment may be limitedto the value of our common stock.”S-9DILUTIONOur net tangible book value as of September 30, 2020, as adjustedto give effect to certain issuances that occurred after such date, was approximately $25,041,063, or $0.79 per share of commonstock. Net tangible book value per share is calculated by subtracting our total liabilities from our total tangible assets, whichis total assets less intangible assets, and dividing this amount by the number of shares of common stock outstanding as of suchdate. After giving effect to the sale by us of 1,132,075 shares of common stock being offered in this offering at an offering priceof $13.25 per share and after deducting the placement agent fees and estimated offering expenses payable by us, and as adjustedto give effect to certain issuances that occurred after September 30, 2020, our as-adjusted net tangible book value as of September30, 2020 would have been approximately $39,191,057, or $1.19 per share of common stock. This represents an immediate increase inthe net tangible book value of $0.40 per share to our existing shareholders and an immediate and substantial dilution in net tangiblebook value of $12.06 per share to new investors. The following table illustrates this hypothetical per share dilution:Offering price per share$13.25Net tangible book value per share as of September 30, 2020, as adjusted to give effect to certain issuances that occurred after such date(1)$0.79Increase in net tangible book value per share attributable to this offering$0.40As adjusted net tangible book value per share as of September 30, 2020, after giving effect to this offering and as adjusted to give effect to certain issuances that occurred after September 30, 2020(1)$1.19Dilution per share to new investors purchasing shares in this offering$12.06(1)Gives effect to:●On November 17, 2020, the Company issued 3,158 shares of common stock pursuant to the exercise of options at an exercise price of $4.48 per share.To the extent that any outstanding options or warrants are exercised,new options are issued under our 2018 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan, 2015 Stock Incentive Plan or Amended and Restated 2012 EmployeeStock Benefit Plan or we otherwise issue additional shares of common stock in the future, there will be further dilution to newinvestors.The above discussion and table are based on 31,858,596 sharesof common stock outstanding as of September 30, 2020, as adjusted to give effect to the issuances described in the footnote abovethat occurred after such date, and excludes the following securities:●2,764,600 shares of our common stock issuable upon the exercise of options and deferred stock units outstanding under our 2018 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan, at a weighted average price of $3.83 per share, as of September 30, 2020;●661,859 shares of our common stock issuable upon the exercise of options outstanding under our 2015 Stock Incentive Plan, at a weighted average price of $2.93 per share, as of September 30, 2020;●608,312 shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of warrants under our Amended and Restated 2012 Employee Stock Benefit Plan, at a weighted average price of $0.58 per share, as of September 30, 2020;●1,051,915 shares of our common stock reserved for future issuance under our 2018 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan, 5,444 shares of our common stock reserved for future issuance under our 2015 Stock Incentive Plan, and 1 share of our common stock reserved for future issuance under our Amended and Restated 2012 Employee Stock Benefit Plan, as of September 30, 2020;●122,238 shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of underwriter warrants issued in connection with our September 2017 Regulation A offering, at an exercise price of $7.475 per share;●471,429 shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of warrants issued in connection with our December 27, 2018 S-3 shelf offering, at a price of $3.50 per share; and●100,000 shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of investor warrants issued in connection with our October 8, 2019 S-3 shelf offering, at an exercise price of $2.83 per share.S-10PLANOF DISTRIBUTIONWe have engaged A.G.P./Alliance GlobalPartners (the “placement agent”) to act as our exclusive placement agent in connection with this offering of our sharesof common stock pursuant to this prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus.

These provisions are expected to encourage persons seekingto acquire control of our Company to first negotiate with our board of directors. We believe that the benefits of increasing ourability to negotiate with the proponent of an unfriendly or unsolicited proposal to acquire or restructure our Company outweighthe disadvantages of discouraging these proposals because negotiation of these proposals could result in an improvement of theirterms.OregonBusiness Combination ActWeare subject to the Oregon Business Combination Act, an anti-takeover law. In general, the Oregon Business Combination Act prohibitsa publicly held Oregon corporation from engaging in a “business combination” with an “interested shareholder”for a period of three years following the date the person became an interested shareholder, unless:●the    board of directors approves the transaction in which the shareholder became an interested shareholder prior to the date the    interested shareholder attained that status;●when    the shareholder became an interested shareholder, he or she owned at least 85% of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding    at the time the transaction commenced, excluding shares owned by directors and officers and certain shares owned by employee    benefits plans; or●on    or subsequent to the date the business combination is approved by the board of directors, the business combination is authorized    by the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3% of the voting stock not owned by the interested shareholder.Generally,a “business combination” includes a merger, asset or stock sale, or other transaction resulting in a financial benefitto the interested shareholder. Generally, an “interested shareholder” is a person who, together with affiliates andassociates, owns, or is an affiliate or associate of the corporation and within three years prior to the determination of interestedshareholder status did own, 15% or more of a corporation’s voting stock.OregonControl Share ActWeare subject to the Oregon Control Share Act, under which a person who acquires voting stock in a transaction that results in theperson holding more than 20%, 33 1/3% or 50% of the total voting power cannot vote the shares it acquires in the acquisition unlessvoting rights are accorded to such control shares:●by    the holders of a majority of the outstanding voting shares, excluding the control shares held by such person and shares held    by our officers and directors who are also employees of our Company, or inside directors; and●by    the holders of a majority of the outstanding voting shares, including the control shares held by such person and shares held    by our officers and inside directors.Thisvote would be required at the time an acquiring person’s holdings exceed 20% of the total voting power, and again at thetime the acquiring person’s holdings exceed 33 1/3% and 50%, respectively.TheOregon Control Share Act and the Oregon Business Combination Act could have the effect of encouraging potential acquirers to negotiatewith our board of directors and discourage potential acquirers unwilling to comply with the provisions of these laws. These lawsalso may delay, defer or prevent a tender offer or takeover attempt of our Company that a shareholder might consider in the shareholder’sbest interest, including those attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares held by our shareholders.An Oregon corporation may provide in its articles of incorporation or bylaws that the laws described above do not apply to itsshares. We have not adopted such a provision and do not currently intend to do so.S-12CharterDocumentsOurRestated Articles and Bylaws include a number of provisions that may have the effect of deterring acquisition proposals or delayingor preventing changes in control or management of our Company.RestatedArticles●Best    Interests of the Company. Oregon law and our Restated Articles authorize our board of directors, in all matters, to consider    the social, legal and economic effects on our employees and on the communities and geographical areas in which we operate,    the long-term and short-term interests of us and our shareholders, and our effect on the environment. Because our board of    directors is not required to make any determination on matters affecting potential takeovers solely based on its judgment    as to the best interests of our shareholders, our board could act in a manner that would discourage an acquisition attempt    or other transaction that some, or a majority, of our shareholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which    such shareholders might receive a premium for their stock over the then market price of such stock.●No    Cumulative Voting. Our Restated Articles do not include a provision for cumulative voting for directors. Under cumulative    voting, a minority shareholder holding a sufficient percentage of a class of shares may be able to ensure the election of    one or more directors.●Preferred    Stock. We are authorized to issue “blank check” preferred stock, which, although intended primarily as a financing    tool and not as a defense against takeovers, could potentially be used by our board of directors, without any further vote    or action by our shareholders, to make uninvited attempts to acquire control more difficult by, for example, diluting the    ownership interest or voting power of a substantial shareholder, increasing the consideration necessary to effect an acquisition    or selling unissued shares to a friendly third party. Bylaws●Amendments.    Our board of directors may alter our Bylaws without obtaining shareholder approval.●Number    of Directors. The number of directors on our board, which may range from one to five directors, may be changed by resolution    of the board of directors without any further vote or action by our shareholders.●Board    Vacancies. Newly created directorships resulting from an increase in our authorized number of directors and vacancies    in our board resulting from death, resignation or removal will be filled by a majority of our board then in office.Theseprovisions of our Restated Articles, our Bylaws and Oregon law could discourage potential acquisition proposals and delay or preventa change in control or management of our Company.LEGALMATTERSNelsonMullins Riley  Scarborough LLP has passed upon the validity of the common stock offered by this prospectus supplement.EXPERTSThefinancial statements of Arcimoto, Inc. included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K as of December 31, 2019 and2018 and for the years then ended have been audited by dbbmckennon, independent registered public accounting firm, as setforth in their report thereon and incorporated herein by reference.

If we so indicate in the applicable prospectus supplement, holders of therights may surrender securities as all or part of the exercise price for rights.Wemay determine to offer any unsubscribed offered securities directly to shareholders, persons other than shareholders, to or throughagents, underwriters or dealers or through a combination of such methods, including pursuant to standby underwriting, backstopor other arrangements, as set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement.Priorto exercising their rights, holders of rights will not have any of the rights of holders of the securities purchasable upon subscription,including, in the case of rights to purchase common stock or preferred stock, the right to receive dividends, if any, or paymentsupon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up or to exercise any voting rights or, in the case of rights to purchase debt securities,the right to receive principal, premium, if any, or interest payments, on the debt securities purchasable upon exercise or toenforce covenants in the applicable indenture.CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF OREGON LAW, OURSECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION AND SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED BYLAWSCertain provisions of Oregon law, our Restated Articles andour Bylaws discussed below may have the effect of making more difficult or discouraging a tender offer, proxy contest or othertakeover attempt. These provisions are expected to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of our Company to first negotiatewith our board of directors. We believe that the benefits of increasing our ability to negotiate with the proponent of an unfriendlyor unsolicited proposal to acquire or restructure our Company outweigh the disadvantages of discouraging these proposals becausenegotiation of these proposals could result in an improvement of their terms.Oregon Business Combination Act We are subject to the Oregon Business Combination Act, an anti-takeoverlaw. In general, the Oregon Business Combination Act prohibits a publicly held Oregon corporation from engaging in a “businesscombination” with an “interested shareholder” for a period of three years following the date the person becamean interested shareholder, unless:●the board of directors approves the transaction in which the shareholderbecame an interested shareholder prior to the date the interested shareholder attained that status;●when the shareholder became an interested shareholder, he or she ownedat least 85% of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, excluding shares owned bydirectors and officers and certain shares owned by employee benefits plans; or●on or subsequent to the date the business combination is approvedby the board of directors, the business combination is authorized by the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3% of the voting stocknot owned by the interested shareholder.Generally, a “business combination” includes a merger,asset or stock sale, or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested shareholder. Generally, an “interestedshareholder” is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, owns, or is an affiliate or associate of the corporationand within three years prior to the determination of interested shareholder status did own, 15% or more of a corporation’svoting stock.17Oregon Control Share ActWe are subject to the Oregon Control Share Act, under whicha person who acquires voting stock in a transaction that results in the person holding more than 20%, 33 1/3% or 50% of the totalvoting power cannot vote the shares it acquires in the acquisition unless voting rights are accorded to such control shares:●by the holders of a majority of the outstanding voting shares, excludingthe control shares held by such person and shares held by our officers and directors who are also employees of our Company, orinside directors; and●by the holders of a majority of the outstanding voting shares, includingthe control shares held by such person and shares held by our officers and inside directors.This vote would be required at the time an acquiring person’sholdings exceed 20% of the total voting power, and again at the time the acquiring person’s holdings exceed 33 1/3% and 50%,respectively.The Oregon Control Share Act and the Oregon Business CombinationAct could have the effect of encouraging potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors and discourage potentialacquirers unwilling to comply with the provisions of these laws. These laws also may delay, defer or prevent a tender offer ortakeover attempt of our Company that a shareholder might consider in the shareholder’s best interest, including those attemptsthat might result in a premium over the market price for the shares held by our shareholders. An Oregon corporation may providein its articles of incorporation or bylaws that the laws described above do not apply to its shares. We have not adopted such aprovision and do not currently intend to do so.Charter DocumentsOur Restated Articles and Bylaws include a number of provisionsthat may have the effect of deterring acquisition proposals or delaying or preventing changes in control or management of our Company.Restated Articles ●Best Interests of the Company. Oregon law and our RestatedArticles authorize our board of directors, in all matters, to consider the social, legal and economic effects on our employeesand on the communities and geographical areas in which we operate, the long-term and short-term interests of us and our shareholders,and our effect on the environment. Because our board of directors is not required to make any determination on matters affectingpotential takeovers solely based on its judgment as to the best interests of our shareholders, our board could act in a mannerthat would discourage an acquisition attempt or other transaction that some, or a majority, of our shareholders might believe tobe in their best interests or in which such shareholders might receive a premium for their stock over the then market price ofsuch stock.●No Cumulative Voting. Our Restated Articles do not includea provision for cumulative voting for directors. Under cumulative voting, a minority shareholder holding a sufficient percentageof a class of shares may be able to ensure the election of one or more directors. ●Preferred Stock. We are authorized to issue “blank check”preferred stock, which, although intended primarily as a financing tool and not as a defense against takeovers, could potentiallybe used by our board of directors, without any further vote or action by our shareholders, to make uninvited attempts to acquirecontrol more difficult by, for example, diluting the ownership interest or voting power of a substantial shareholder, increasingthe consideration necessary to effect an acquisition or selling unissued shares to a friendly third party.Bylaws●Amendments. Our board of directors may alter our Bylaws withoutobtaining shareholder approval. ●Number of Directors. The number of directors on our board,which may range from one to five directors, may be changed by resolution of the board of directors without any further vote oraction by our shareholders.●Board Vacancies. Newly created directorships resulting froman increase in our authorized number of directors and vacancies in our board resulting from death, resignation or removal willbe filled by a majority of our board then in office. These provisions of our Restated Articles, our Bylaws and Oregonlaw could discourage potential acquisition proposals and delay or prevent a change in control or management of our Company18LEGALMATTERSThevalidity of the securities being offered hereby will be passed upon by Wyrick Robbins Yates  Ponton LLP, Raleigh, North Carolina.EXPERTSThefinancial statements of Arcimoto, Inc. included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K as of December 31, 2017 and2016 and for the years then ended have been audited by dbbmckennon, independent registered public accounting firm, as setforth in their report thereon and incorporated herein by reference.

In consultation with your own financial, tax, accounting and legal advisers, youshould carefully consider, among other matters, the factors set forth below as well as the risk factors discussed in the accompanying prospectus supplement, the accompanying prospectus and in our most recent annual and quarterly reports which areincorporated by reference into this pricing supplement, the accompanying prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus before deciding to make an investment in the Notes. An investment in the Notes by a purchaser whose home currency is not Sterling entails significant risks. An investment in securities which are denominated and payable in a currency other than the currency of the country in which the purchaser isresident or the currency in which the purchaser primarily conducts its business or activities (in each case, the “home currency”) entails significant risks not associated with securities denominated and payable in the home currency.Accordingly, an investment in the Notes by a purchaser whose home currency is not Sterling entails significant risks. These risks include the possibility of significant changes in rates of exchange between the holder’s home currencyand Sterling, the possibility of the imposition or subsequent modification of foreign exchange controls and the possibility of tax consequences for the holder as a result of any foreign exchange gains resulting from an investment in the Notes.These risks generally depend on factors over which we have no control. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates between two currencies result from the interaction over time of many factors directly or indirectly affecting economic,financial and political conditions in the countries issuing such currencies, and economic and political developments globally and in other relevant countries. Foreign currency exchange rates may be affected by, among other factors, existing andexpected rates of inflation, existing and expected interest rate levels, the balance of payments between countries, the aggregate amount of a national government’s outstanding debt, and the extent of governmental surpluses or deficits invarious countries. All of these factors are, in turn, sensitive to the monetary, fiscal and trade policies pursued by the governments of various countries important to international trade and finance. Moreover, current global economic conditions andthe actions taken or to be taken by various national governments in response to such conditions could significantly affect the exchange rates between Sterling and a holder’s home currency. Rates of exchange between Sterling and certain currencies have been highly volatile, and each holder should be aware that such volatility maycontinue to occur. Fluctuations in any particular exchange rate that have occurred in the past, however, are not necessarily indicative of fluctuations in the rate that may occur during the term of the Notes. Depreciation of Sterlingagainst the holder’s home currency would result in a decrease in the effective yield of the Notes below its coupon rate and, in certain circumstances, could result in a loss to the holder. Appreciation of Sterling in relation to theholder’s home currency could have the opposite effects. If, as permitted by the Notes, we make payments in U.S. dollars, you will be exposedto significant risks if your home currency is not U.S. dollars. If Sterling is not available in our good faith judgment for thepayment of principal, premium, if any, or interest with respect to the Notes, including any payments made upon any redemption of the Notes, due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond the control of AHFC, or is no longerused by the United Kingdom or for the settlement of transactions by public institutions of or within the international banking community, AHFC will be entitled to satisfy its obligations to holders of the Notes by making that payment in U.S. dollarson the basis of the market exchange rate as computed by the exchange rate agent on the second Business Day before that payment is due, or if such market exchange rate is not then available, on the basis of the most recently available market exchangerate on or before the date that payment is due or as otherwise determined by AHFC in good faith, if the foregoing is impracticable. There can be no assurance that the exchange rate applicable to the Notes will be as favorable to the holders of suchNotes as the exchange rates that may otherwise be available to such holders at the applicable time of conversion. Any payment in respect of the Notes so made in U.S. dollars will not constitute a default under the Indenture (as defined below). Ifyour home PS-3 currency is not U.S. dollars, any such payment will expose you to the significant risks described above under “—An investment in the Notes by a purchaser whose home currency is notSterling entails significant risks.” Neither the Trustee nor the Paying Agent shall be responsible for obtaining exchange rates, effecting conversions or otherwise handling redenominations.The potential developments regarding theavailability of Sterling and the possible conversion of amounts payable into U.S. dollars, or market perceptions concerning these and related issues, could adversely affect the value of the Notes. Foreign currency judgments are subject to exchange rate risks. The Indenture and the Notes will be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York. New York courtswill normally enter judgments or decrees for money damages in the foreign currency in which foreign currency notes are denominated. These amounts are then converted into U.S. dollars at the rate of exchange in effect on the date the judgment ordecree is entered. Consequently, in a lawsuit for payment on the Notes, Noteholders would bear the currency exchange risk for the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and Sterling until a New York state court judgment is entered, which could be along time. A Federal court sitting in New York with diversity jurisdiction over a dispute arising in connection with the Notes would apply the foregoing New York law. In courts outside of New York, Noteholders may not be able to obtain a judgment in a currency other than U.S. dollars. Forexample, a judgment for money in an action based on the Notes in many other U.S. federal or state courts ordinarily would be enforced in the United States only in U.S. dollars. The date used to determine the rate of conversion ofSterling into U.S. dollars would depend upon various factors, including which court renders the judgment. We cannot assure you that a tradingmarket for the Notes will ever develop or be maintained. The Notes are a new issue of securities and there currently is no secondarymarket in which the Notes can be resold. Although we intend to apply to list the Notes on the New York Stock Exchange, no assurance can be given that we will be able to list the Notes. Even if the Notes are listed, a secondary market maynever develop or be maintained. If a secondary market does develop, it may not continue or it may not be sufficiently liquid to allow you to resell your Notes if or when you want to or at a price that you consider acceptable. From time to time, theUnderwriters may make a market in the Notes, but any market making may be discontinued at any time. In evaluating the Notes, you should assume that you will be holding the Notes until their maturity. Noteholders are exposed to the consequences of denomination of a minimum specified denomination plus a higher integral multiple. The Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of £100,000 and integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof. As is the casewith any issue of Notes that have a denomination consisting of a minimum specified denomination plus a higher integral multiple of another smaller amount, it is possible that the Notes may be traded in amounts in excess of £100,000 (or itsequivalent) that are not integral multiples of £100,000 (or its equivalent). In such a case a Noteholder who, as a result of trading such amounts, holds a principal amount of less than the minimum specified denomination may not receivea definitive note in respect of such holding (should definitive notes be printed) and would need to purchase a principal amount of Notes such that its holding amounts to the minimum specified denomination. The United Kingdom’s impending departure from the European Union could adversely affect the value of the Notes. The United Kingdom held a referendum on June 23, 2016 in which a majority of voters voted to exit the European Union (“Brexit”)and on March 29, 2017, the United Kingdom submitted a formal notification of its intention to withdraw from the European Union pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon. On January 31,PS-4 2020, the United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union under the terms of a withdrawal agreement which provides for a transition period that is currently expected to end on December 31,2020. During the transition period, the United Kingdom will essentially be treated as a member state of the European Union (except that the United Kingdom will not be represented by, or participate in, the decision-making bodies of the EuropeanUnion) and the regulatory regime will remain the same across the United Kingdom and the European Union with all existing trading arrangements being maintained. The future relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union remainsuncertain as the two parties work through the transition period to negotiate the details of their future relationship, including the terms of trade between the United Kingdom and the European Union and potentially other countries. If the transitionperiod ends and no agreement is reached, the default scenario would be a “no-deal” Brexit in which the United Kingdom would leave the European Union with no agreements in place beyond (i) anytemporary arrangements that have or may be put in place by the European Union, or individual member states of the European Union, and the United Kingdom as part of no-deal contingency efforts and(ii) those conferred by mutual membership of the World Trade Organization. The effects of Brexit on the value of the Notes willdepend on whatever agreements the United Kingdom makes to retain access to European Union markets either during a transitional period or more permanently. Brexit could adversely affect European and worldwide economic and market conditions and couldcontribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets, including volatility in the value of Sterling. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the UnitedKingdom determines which European Union laws to replace or replicate, including competition laws. Any of these effects of Brexit, and others we cannot anticipate, could negatively impact the liquidity and/or value of the Notes. PS-5 CURRENCY CONVERSION Principal, premium, if any, and interest payments in respect of the Notes, including any payments made upon any redemption in respect of theNotes, will be payable in Sterling. If Sterling is not available in our good faith judgment for the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest with respect to the Notes, including any payments made upon any redemption of the Notes, due tothe imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond the control of AHFC, or is no longer used by the United Kingdom or for the settlement of transactions by public institutions of or within the international banking community, AHFCwill be entitled to satisfy its obligations to holders of the Notes by making that payment in U.S. dollars on the basis of the market exchange rate as computed by the exchange rate agent on the second Business Day before that payment is due, or ifsuch market exchange rate is not then available, on the basis of the most recently available market exchange rate on or before the date that payment is due or as otherwise determined by AHFC in good faith, if the foregoing is impracticable. Any payment in respect of the Notes so made in U.S. dollars will not constitute a default under the Indenture. Neither the Trustee nor thePaying Agent shall be responsible for obtaining exchange rates, effecting conversions or otherwise handling redenominations. Investorswill be subject to foreign exchange risks as to payments of principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on, the Notes, including any payments made upon any redemption of the Notes, that may have important economic and tax consequences tothem. See “Risk Factors.” You should consult your own financial, legal and tax advisors as to the risks involved in an investment in the Notes. On November 17, 2020, the Sterling/U.S.$ rate of exchange was £1.00/U.S.$1.3246, as reported by Bloomberg. Any information provided in this pricing supplement concerning exchange rates is provided as a matter of information only and you should notregard it as indicative of the range of or trends in fluctuations in currency exchange rates that may occur in the future. PS-6 USE OF PROCEEDS We expect to receive net proceeds from the sale of the Notes, after deducting the underwriting discount and expenses payable by us, ofapproximately £                 , or $                , based on the Sterling/U.S.$rate of exchange of £1.00/U.S.$1.3246 as of November 17, 2020, as reported by Bloomberg. We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering for general corporate purposes. Pending such applications, such proceeds may be temporarilyinvested in short-term marketable securities. PS-7 DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES General The Notes are a tranche of ourMedium-Term Notes, Series A. The Notes will be issued under an indenture dated as of September 5, 2013, between us and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee (the “Trustee”), as supplemented by the First SupplementalIndenture, dated as of February 8, 2018, between AHFC and the Trustee (as so supplemented, the “Indenture”). The terms of the Notes include those provisions contained in the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture byreference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the “Trust Indenture Act”). This description supplements, and to the extent inconsistent, supersedes, the description of the general terms and provisions of the debtsecurities found in the accompanying prospectus and our Medium-Term Notes, Series A, described in the accompanying prospectus supplement.The following summary of specified provisions of the Indenture and the Notes does not purport to becomplete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the actual provisions of the Indenture, including the definitions contained in the Indenture of some of the terms used below, and the Notes,a copy of which has beenfiled as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this pricing supplement and accompanying prospectus supplement and prospectus are a part. The Notes initially will be limited to an aggregate principal amount of£                . See “—Further Issuances” below. The Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of £100,000 and integral multiplesof £1,000 in excess thereof. The Notes will be our general unsecured and unsubordinated obligations, will rank equally with all ofour existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness from time to time outstanding and will be considered part of the same series of notes as any of our other Medium-Term Notes, Series A, previously issued or issued in the future. TheIndenture does not limit the amount of Notes, debentures or other evidence of indebtedness that we may issue under the Indenture or otherwise and provides that debt securities under the Indenture may be issued from time to time in one or moreseries. We have initially designated Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas as our paying agent (the “Paying Agent”), registrarand transfer agent where Notes may be presented for payment. The entire principal amount of the Notes will mature and become payable,together with unpaid interest, if any, accrued thereon on                 (the “Stated Maturity Date”) unless redeemed earlier as described below under“—Optional Redemption” and “—Redemption for Tax Reasons.” The Notes will not be subject to any sinking fund provisions and will not be convertible into or exchangeable for any of our equity interests. The principal of each Note payable at maturity or earlier redemption will be paid in Sterling against presentation and surrender at the officeor agency maintained for such purpose. Under the Indenture, holders of the Notes will vote with holders of all other tranches of ourMedium-Term Notes, Series A, as a single class. As of November 17, 2020, we had approximately $21.45 billion aggregate principal amount (approximately £16.19 billion aggregate principal amount based on the Sterling/U.S.$ rate ofexchange of £1.00/U.S.$1.3246 as of November 17, 2020, as reported by Bloomberg), €4.30 billion aggregate principal amount (approximately £3.85 billion aggregate principal amount based on the Sterling/euro rate of exchange of£1.00/€1.1166 as of November 17, 2020, as reported by Bloomberg) and £600.0 million aggregate principal amount of Medium-Term Notes, Series A, outstanding under the Indenture. The Indenture contains provisions that require the consent of or action by a specified percentage of the aggregate principal amount of ourMedium-Term Notes, Series A, acting as a single class. For example, holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of our Medium-Term Notes, Series A, as a single class, may consent to certain modifications or amendments to the Indenture andwaiver of certain continuing defaults under the PS-8 Indenture, as described under “Description of Debt Securities—Modification, Waivers and Meetings” in the accompanying prospectus, and holders of at least 25% in aggregate principalamount of our Medium-Term Notes, Series A, as a single class, may declare the principal amount of our Medium-Term Notes, Series A, to be due and payable immediately upon the occurrence of certain events of default, as described under“Description of Debt Securities—Events of Default” in the accompanying prospectus. Therefore, because the Medium-Term Notes, Series A, vote as a single class, a greater percentage of the principal amount of the Notes may be requiredto take action under the Indenture and the aggregate principal amount of the Notes may not be sufficient to take action under the Indenture in the future. In addition, under the accompanying prospectus supplement, we may issue up to $30,000,000,000aggregate principal amount (approximately £22.65 billion aggregate principal amount based on the Sterling/U.S.$ rate of exchange of £1.00/U.S.$1.3246 as of November 17, 2020, as reported by Bloomberg) of Medium-Term Notes,Series A, under the Indenture, of which, as of November 17, 2020, $10.79 billion aggregate principal amount (approximately £8.15 billion aggregate principal amount based on the Sterling/U.S.$ rate of exchange of£1.00/U.S.$1.3246 as of November 17, 2020, as reported by Bloomberg) of Medium-Term Notes, Series A has previously been issued. We may increase the authorized aggregate principal amount of our Medium-Term Notes, Series A, at any timewithout your consent. The Notes will bear interestat                % per year and will accrue from                 , 2020 (the“Settlement Date”) or from the immediately preceding interest payment date to which interest has been paid. Interest on the Notes is payable annually in arrearson                 , commencing                 , 2021 (each an “Interest PaymentDate”). Interest payable on an Interest Payment Date will be paid to the persons in whose names the Notes are registered at the close of business on the regular record date; provided, however, that interest payable at the Stated Maturity Dateor earlier redemption date will be payable to the person to whom principal shall be payable. The regular record date for the Notes will be the fifteenth calendar day, whether or not a Business Day, immediately preceding the related Interest PaymentDate. Interest payable on an Interest Payment Date will be computed on the basis of an Actual/Actual (ICMA) (as defined in the rulebook of the International Capital Market Association) day count convention. If any Interest Payment Date, the Stated Maturity Date or earlier redemption date falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the relatedpayment of principal, premium, if any, or interest and Additional Amounts, if any, will be made on the next succeeding Business Day as if made on the date the applicable payment was due, and no interest will accrue on the amount so payable for theperiod from and after such Interest Payment Date, the Stated Maturity Date or such redemption date, as the case may be, to the date of such payment on the next succeeding Business Day. For purposes of the Notes, “Business Day” means anyday, other than a Saturday or Sunday, which is not a day on which banking institutions in The City of New York or London are authorized or required by law, regulation or executive order to close. Issuance of the Notes in Sterling Initial holders will be required to pay for the Notes in Sterling, and principal, premium, if any, and interest payments in respect of theNotes, including any payments made upon any redemption of the Notes, will be payable in Sterling. If Sterling is not available in ourgood faith judgment for the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest with respect to the Notes, including payments of redemption on the Notes, due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond the control of AHFC, oris no longer used by the United Kingdom or for the settlement of transactions by public institutions of or within the international banking community, AHFC will be entitled to satisfy its obligations to holders of the Notes by making that payment inU.S. dollars on the basis of the Market Exchange Rate (as defined below) as computed by the exchange rate agent on the second Business Day before that payment is due, or if such Market Exchange Rate is not then available, on the basis of the mostrecently available Market Exchange Rate on or before the date that payment is due or as otherwise determined by AHFC in good faith, if the foregoing is impracticable. Any payment in respect of the Notes so made in U.S. dollars will not constitute adefault under the Indenture. Neither the Trustee nor the PS-9 Paying Agent shall be responsible for obtaining exchange rates, effecting conversions or otherwise handling redenominations. The “Market Exchange Rate” means the noon buying rate in The City of New York for cable transfers of Sterling as certified forcustoms purposes (or, if not so certified, as otherwise determined) by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. In the event that Sterling,or an official redenomination of Sterling, is no longer used by the United Kingdom, AHFC’s obligations with respect to payments on the Notes shall, in each case, be regarded immediately following such redenomination as providing for the paymentof that amount of Sterling representing the amount of such obligations immediately before such redenomination. The Notes do not provide for any adjustment to any amount payable under the Notes as a result of any change in the value of Sterlingrelative to any other currency due solely to fluctuations in exchange rates. All determinations referred to above made by the exchangerate agent will be at its sole discretion and will, in the absence of clear error, be conclusive for all purposes and binding on the holders of the Notes. Further Issuances We may, from time totime, without notice to or the consent of the holders of the Notes, create and issue additional notes, having the same ranking, interest rate, Stated Maturity Date, redemption provisions and other terms as the Notes, as applicable, except for(1) the original issue date, (2) the issue price and (3) in some cases, the first interest payment date; provided, however, such additional notes must be fungible with the previously issued notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes.Additional notes will be considered part of the same series of notes as the Notes and any of our other Medium-Term Notes, Series A previously issued or issued in the future. We also may, from time to time, without notice to or the consent of theholders of the Notes, create and issue additional debt securities, under the Indenture or otherwise, ranking equally with the Notes and our other Medium-Term Notes, Series A. Optional Redemption The Notes will beredeemable before their maturity, in whole or in part, at our option, at any time, at a “make-whole” redemption price in cash equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed and (ii) the sum of thepresent values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal of and interest on the Notes to be redeemed (exclusive of interest accrued to but excluding the redemption date) discounted to the redemption date on an annual basis (based on anActual/Actual (ICMA) (as defined in the rulebook of International Capital Market Association) day count convention) at the applicable Comparable Government Bond Rate plus basis points, plus, in each of clause (i) and (ii), unpaid interest, ifany, thereon accrued to but excluding the redemption date. The following definitions will apply with respect to the foregoing: “Comparable Government Bond” means, in relation to any Comparable Government Bond Rate calculation, at the discretion of anIndependent Investment Banker, a United Kingdom government bond whose maturity is closest to the maturity of the Notes to be redeemed, or if the Independent Investment Banker in its discretion determines that such similar bond is not in issue, suchother United Kingdom government bond as such Independent Investment Banker may, with the advice of three brokers of, and/or market makers in, United Kingdom government bonds selected by such Independent Investment Banker, determine to be appropriatefor determining the Comparable Government Bond Rate;. “Comparable Government Bond Rate” means the price, expressed as apercentage (rounded to three decimal places, with 0.0005 being rounded upwards), at which the gross redemption yield on the Notes to be redeemed, if they were to be purchased at such price on the third Business Day prior to the date fixed forredemption, would be equal to the gross redemption yield on such Business Day of the Comparable Government Bond on the basis of the middle market price of the Comparable Government Bond prevailing at 11:00 a.m. (London time) on such Business Day asdetermined by an Independent Investment Banker. PS-10 “Independent Investment Banker” means each of Barclays Bank PLC, BNP Paribas,Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, and Société Générale and their respective successors, or, if such firm is unwilling or unable to select the Comparable Government Bond, an independent investment banking institution ofinternational standing appointed by AHFC. Notice of any redemption will be given in writing not more than 60 nor less than 30 days beforethe redemption date to each holder of the Notes to be redeemed. Such notice of redemption shall specify the principal amount of Notes to be redeemed, ISIN and Common Code numbers of the Notes to be redeemed, the redemption date, the redemptionprice, the place or places of payment and that payment will be made upon presentation and surrender of such Notes. Unless we default in payment of the redemption price, on and after the redemption date interest will cease to accrue on the Notes orportions thereof called for redemption. If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed, the Trustee will select Notes to be redeemed,which, in the case of Notes in book-entry form, will be in accordance with the procedures of the applicable depositary. The Trustee may select the Notes and portions of the Notes in amounts of £100,000 and integral multiples of £1,000 inexcess thereof. Payment of Additional Amounts We will, subject to the exceptions and limitations set forth below, pay as additional interest such Additional Amounts as are necessary inorder that the net amount of such payment of the principal of and interest on a Note to a holder who is a United States Alien (as such term is defined below), after deduction for any present or future tax, assessment or governmental charge of theUnited States (as such term is defined below), or a political subdivision or authority thereof or therein, imposed by withholding with respect to the payment, will not be less than the amount provided for in such Note to be then due and payable.However, the foregoing obligation to pay Additional Amounts shall not apply: (a) to any tax, assessment or governmental charge that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of anypresent or former connection between such holder (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder of, or holder of power over, such holder, if such holder is an estate, trust, partnership or corporation) and the United States,including, without limitation, such holder (or such fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member, shareholder or holder of a power) being considered as: (i) being or having been present or engaged in a trade or business in the United States or having had a permanentestablishment therein;

(c) to any holder that is a fiduciary or partnership or other than the sole beneficial owner of the Note, but onlyto the extent that a beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary or member of such partnership or a beneficial owner of the Note would not have been entitled to the payment of such Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settlor, memberor beneficial owner been the holder of such Note; PS-11 (d) to any tax, assessment or governmental charge that would not have been imposed or withheld but for the failureof the holder or any other person to comply with certification, identification or information reporting requirements under United States income tax laws, without regard to any tax treaty, with respect to the payment, concerning the nationality,residence, identity or connection with the United States of the holder or a beneficial owner of such Note, if such compliance is required by United States income tax laws, without regard to any tax treaty, as a precondition to relief or exemptionfrom such tax, assessment or governmental charge; (e) to any tax, assessment or governmental charge that is imposed otherwise than by withholding by us or a payingagent from the payment; (f) to any tax, assessment or governmental charge that would not have been so imposed or withheld but for thepresentation by the holder of such Note for payment on a date more than 15 days after the date on which such payment became due and payable or the date on which payment thereof is duly provided for, whichever occurs later; (g) to any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, excise, wealth or personal property tax or any similar tax,assessment or governmental charge; (h) to any withholding or deduction that is imposed on a payment to an individual and that is required to be madepursuant to any law implementing or complying with, or introduced to conform to, any European Union Directive on the taxation of savings;

Prior to the transmission or publication of any notice of redemption pursuant to this paragraph, we shall deliver to the Trustee acertificate signed by two directors of AHFC stating that we are entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to our right to so redeem the Notes has occurred. Modification of the Indenture See“Description of Debt Securities—Modification, Waivers and Meetings” in the accompanying prospectus. Events of Default, Notice andWaiver See “Description of Debt Securities—Events of Default” in the accompanying prospectus. Discharge, Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance The defeasance provisions described in the accompanying prospectus under “Description of Debt Securities—Discharge, Legal Defeasanceand Covenant Defeasance” will be applicable to the Notes. Governing Law The Indenture is governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, and, once issued, the Notes will be as well.Book-Entry Delivery and Settlement We have obtained the information in this section concerning Clearstream and Euroclear and their book-entry systems and procedures from sourcesthat we believe to be reliable. We take no responsibility for an accurate portrayal of this information. In addition, the description of the clearing systems in this section reflects our understanding of the rules and procedures of Clearstream andEuroclear as they are currently in effect. Those systems could change their rules and procedures at any time. Global Clearance and SettlementThe Notes will be issued in the form of one or more global notes in fully registered form, without coupons, and will be depositedwith, or on behalf of, a common depositary for, and in respect of interests held through, Euroclear and Clearstream. Except as described herein, certificates will not be issued in exchange for beneficial interests in the global notes. Except as set forth below, the global notes may be transferred, in whole and not in part, only to the common depositary, its successors ortheir respective nominees. Beneficial interests in the global notes will be represented, and transfers of such beneficial interests willbe effected, through accounts of financial institutions acting on behalf of beneficial owners as direct or indirect participants in Euroclear or Clearstream. Those beneficial interests will be in denominations of £100,000 and integralmultiples of £1,000 in excess thereof. Investors may hold Notes directly through Euroclear or Clearstream, if they are participants in such systems, or indirectly through organizations that are participants in such systems. Owners of beneficial interests in the global notes will not be entitled to have Notes registered in their names, and, except as describedherein, will not receive or be entitled to receive physical delivery of Notes in definitive PS-13 form. So long as the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream or such common depositary’s nominee is the registered holder of the global notes, the common depositary or such nominee,as the case may be, will be considered the sole holder of the Notes represented by the global notes for all purposes under the Indenture and the global notes. Except as provided below, beneficial owners will not be considered the owners or holdersof the Notes under the Indenture, including for purposes of receiving any reports delivered by us or the Trustee pursuant to the Indenture. Accordingly, each beneficial owner must rely on the procedures of the clearing systems and, if such person isnot a participant of the clearing systems, on the procedures of the participant through which such person owns its interest, to exercise any rights of a holder under the Indenture. Under existing industry practices, if we request any action ofholders or a beneficial owner desires to give or take any action which a holder is entitled to give or take under the Indenture, the clearing systems would authorize their participants holding the relevant beneficial interests to give or take actionand the participants would authorize beneficial owners owning through the participants to give or take such action or would otherwise act upon the instructions of beneficial owners. Conveyance of notices and other communications by the clearingsystems to their participants, by the participants to indirect participants and by the participants and indirect participants to beneficial owners will be governed by arrangements among them, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements asmay be in effect from time to time. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive form. These limits and laws may impair the ability to transfer beneficialinterests in global notes. Clearstream Clearstream has advised that it is incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg and licensed as a bank and professional depositary. Clearstreamholds securities for its participating organizations and facilitates the clearance and settlement of securities transactions among its participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of its participants, thereby eliminating the needfor physical movement of certificates. Clearstream provides to its participants, among other things, services for safekeeping, administration, clearance and settlement of internationally traded securities and securities lending and borrowing.Clearstream interfaces with domestic markets in several countries. Clearstream has established an electronic bridge with the Euroclear Operator (as defined below) to facilitate the settlement of trades between Clearstream and Euroclear. As aregistered bank in Luxembourg, Clearstream is subject to regulation by the Luxembourg Commission for the Supervision of the Financial Sector. Clearstream customers are recognized financial institutions around the world, including underwriters,securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations and may include the Underwriters. Indirect access to Clearstream is also available to others, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trustcompanies that clear through, or maintain a custodial relationship with, a Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly. Distributions with respect to Notes held beneficially through Clearstream will be credited to cash accounts of Clearstream participants inaccordance with its rules and procedures. Euroclear Euroclear has advised that it was created in 1968 to hold securities for its participants and to clear and settle transactions betweenEuroclear participants through simultaneous electronic book-entry delivery against payment, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of certificates and any risk from lack of simultaneous transfers of securities and cash. Euroclearincludes various other services, including securities lending and borrowing and interfaces with domestic markets in several countries. Euroclear is operated by Euroclear Bank SA/NV (the “Euroclear Operator”). All operations are conductedby the Euroclear Operator, and all Euroclear securities clearance accounts and Euroclear cash accounts are accounts with the Euroclear Operator. Euroclear participants include banks (including central banks), securities brokers and dealers and otherprofessional financial intermediaries and may include the Underwriters. Indirect access to Euroclear is also available to other firms that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear participant, either directly orindirectly. PS-14 Securities clearance accounts and cash accounts with the Euroclear Operator are governed bythe Terms and Conditions Governing Use of Euroclear and the related operating procedures of Euroclear, and applicable Belgian law (collectively, the “Terms and Conditions”). The Terms and Conditions govern transfers of securities and cashwithin Euroclear, withdrawals of securities and cash from Euroclear, and receipts of payments with respect to securities in Euroclear. All securities in Euroclear are held on a fungible basis without attribution of specific certificates to specificsecurities clearance accounts. The Euroclear Operator acts under the Terms and Conditions only on behalf of Euroclear participants, and has no records of or relationship with persons holding through Euroclear participants. Distributions with respect to the Notes held beneficially through Euroclear will be credited to the cash accounts of Euroclear participants inaccordance with the Terms and Conditions. Euroclear and Clearstream Arrangements So long as the common depositary for Euroclear or Clearstream or such common depositary’s nominee is the registered holder of the globalnotes, the common depositary or such nominee, as the case may be, will be considered the sole owner or holder of the Notes represented by such global notes for all purposes under the Indenture and the Notes. Payments of principal, interest andAdditional Amounts, if any, in respect of the global notes will be made to the common depositary or such common depositary’s nominee, as the case may be, as registered holder thereof. None of us, the Trustee, any agent and any affiliate of anyof the above or any person by whom any of the above is controlled (as such term is defined in the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the “Securities Act”) will have any responsibility or liability for any records relating to orpayments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in the global notes or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests. Distributions of principal, premium, if any, and interest with respect to the global notes, including any payments made upon any redemption ofthe global notes, will be credited in Sterling to the extent received by Euroclear or Clearstream from the Paying Agent to the cash accounts of Euroclear or Clearstream customers in accordance with the relevant system’s rules and procedures.Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants, the abilityof a person having an interest in the global notes to pledge such interest to persons or entities which do not participate in the relevant clearing system, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be affected by the lack of aphysical certificate in respect of such interest. Initial Settlement We understand that investors that hold their Notes through Clearstream or Euroclear accounts will follow the settlement procedures that areapplicable to conventional eurobonds in registered form. Subject to applicable procedures of Clearstream and Euroclear, Notes will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Clearstream and Euroclear participants on the business day followingthe settlement date, for value on the settlement date. Secondary Market Trading Because the purchaser determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of trading of any Notes where both thepurchaser’s and seller’s accounts are located to ensure that settlement can be made on the desired value date. We understandthat secondary market trading between Clearstream and/or Euroclear participants will occur in the ordinary way following the applicable rules and operating procedures of Clearstream and Euroclear. Secondary market trading will be settled usingprocedures applicable to conventional eurobonds in registered form. PS-15 You should be aware that investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries,payments and other communications involving the Notes through Clearstream and Euroclear on days when those systems are open for business. Those systems may not be open for business on days when banks, brokers and other institutions are open forbusiness in the United States. In addition, because of time-zone differences, there may be problems with completing transactionsinvolving Clearstream and Euroclear on the same business day as in the United States. U.S. investors who wish to transfer their interests in the Notes, or to make or receive a payment or delivery of the Notes, on a particular day, may find thatthe transactions will not be performed until the next business day in Luxembourg or Brussels, depending on whether Clearstream or Euroclear is used. Clearstream or Euroclear will credit payments to the cash accounts of Clearstream customers or Euroclear participants, as applicable, inaccordance with the relevant system’s rules and procedures, to the extent received by its depositary. Clearstream or the Euroclear Operator, as the case may be, will take any other action permitted to be taken by a holder under the Indenture onbehalf of a Clearstream customer or Euroclear participant only in accordance with its relevant rules and procedures. Clearstream andEuroclear have agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of the Notes among participants of Clearstream and Euroclear. However, they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform those procedures, and they maydiscontinue those procedures at any time. Exchange of Global Notes for Certificated Notes Subject to certain conditions, the Notes represented by the global notes are exchangeable for notes in definitive form of like tenor in minimumdenominations of £100,000 principal amount and multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof if: (1) Clearstream, Euroclear or any successor thereto notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to act as a clearingsystem for the Notes; (2) we, at our option, notify the Trustee in writing that we elect to cause the issuance of certificated notes withrespect to the Notes; or (3) there has occurred and is continuing an event of default with respect to the Notes. In all cases, definitive notes delivered in exchange for any global note or beneficial interest therein will be registered in the names, andissued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of the common depositary (in accordance with its customary procedures).

UnderwritersAggregate PrincipalAmount of Notes Barclays Bank PLC.£ BNP Paribas Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch Société Générale Total£                    The Notes are a new issue of securities for which no established trading market exists. Although we intend toapply to list the Notes on the New York Stock Exchange, no assurance can be given that we will be able to list the Notes. Even if the Notes are listed, no assurance can be given that an active trading market for the Notes will develop or bemaintained. If an active trading market does not develop or is not maintained for the Notes, Noteholders may not be able to resell them at all or at prices acceptable to them. The Underwriters may from time to time make a market in the Notes but arenot obligated to do so and may cease at any time. Neither we nor the Underwriters can assure you that any trading market for the Notes will develop, continue or be liquid. The Notes sold by the Underwriters to the public will initially be offered at the public offering price set forth on the cover page of thispricing supplement. After the Notes are released for sale, the Underwriters may change the offering price and the other selling terms. The Underwriters are offering the Notes, subject to prior sale, when, as and if issued to and accepted by them,subject to approval of legal matters by their counsel and other conditions contained in the Terms Agreement, such as the receipt by the Underwriters of officers’ certificates and legal opinions. The Underwriters reserve the right to withdraw,cancel or modify offers to the public and to reject orders in whole or in part. We have agreed to provide the Underwriters anunderwriting discount of    % of the principal amount of the Notes in connection with this offering. The expenses of this offering, not including the underwriting discount, are estimated at approximately$            and are payable by us. In connection with this offering,Barclays Bank PLC, on behalf of the Underwriters, is permitted to engage in certain transactions that stabilize the price of the Notes. These transactions may consist of bids or purchases for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the priceof the Notes. If the Underwriters create a short position in the Notes in connection with this offering by selling more Notes than they have purchased from us, then the Underwriters may reduce that short position by purchasing Notes in the openmarket. In general, purchases of Notes for the purpose of stabilization or to reduce a short position may cause the price of the Notes to be higher than in the absence of these purchases. The Underwriters are not required to engage in theseactivities, and may end any of these activities at any time. Neither we nor any of the Underwriters make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price ofthe Notes. It is expected that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefor on or about November    ,2020, which will be the third U.S. business day following the date of the pricing of the Notes. Under Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, trades in the secondary marketgenerally are required PS-17 to settle in two U.S. business days, unless the parties to a trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on any date prior to the two U.S. business daysbefore the original issue date will be required to specify alternative settlement arrangements to prevent a failed settlement. We mayenter into hedging transactions in connection with the issuance of the Notes, including forwards, futures, options, interest rate or exchange rate swaps and repurchase or reverse repurchase transactions with, or arranged by, any of the Underwritersor an affiliate of that Underwriter.

The market price of our Ordinary Shares could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose allor part of your investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations andprospects. Some statements in this prospectus supplement, including statements in the following risk factors, constitute forward-looking statements. See “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.” Risks Related to Our Business The effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic are having a significant material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and prospects, and if the pandemic is long-lastingthese effects will become increasingly severe. The outbreak of thecoronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has led governments and other authorities around the world to impose measures intended to control its spread, including restrictions on freedom of movement andbusiness operations such as travel bans, border closings, business closures, quarantines and shelter-in-place orders. As a result, the pandemic hassignificantly disrupted global travel, and has adversely impacted global commercial activity across the travel, lodging and hospitality industries. The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and is expected tocontinue to have, significant adverse impacts on economic and market conditions and has resulted in a global economic contraction. Theeffects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the hospitality industry are unprecedented with global demand for lodging drastically reduced and occupancy levels reaching historic lows. Due to the rapidand broad spread of the virus and in response to related governmental restrictions and advisories, reductions in scheduled airline services and potential health risks to our employees and guests, we temporarily suspended operations at all of ourresorts in late March 2020. Our resorts began reopening in July, in stages, based on incremental easing of government restrictions and advisories and increases in scheduled commercial airline service. As a result of the suspension of operations atall of our resorts, we had no revenues from resort operations in the second quarter of 2020. As of November 13, 2020, 17 out of our 21 resorts had reopened and we anticipate opening most of the remaining resorts during the fourth quarter of2020. However, we have experienced severely reduced occupancy at the resorts that have reopened due to the effects of the pandemic. We cannot predict when the effects of the pandemic will subside, or if there will be a resurgence of the virus, andthus we cannot predict whether our opened resorts will be permitted to remain open or when our business at opened resorts will return to normalized or even break-even levels. The longer and more severe the pandemic, and if there are repeat orcyclical outbreaks of the COVID-19 virus beyond the one being currently experienced, the greater the material adverse effect will be on our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations,prospects and access to equity and credit markets and ability to service our indebtedness. There also can be no guarantee that when theeffects of the pandemic subside the demand for lodging, and consumer confidence in travel generally, will recover as quickly and fully as other industries. Additionally, the effects of the pandemic have had, and we expect will continue to have, amaterial adverse effect on our ability to consummate acquisitions and dispositions of resorts and our ability to timely complete planned capital expenditures and other projects. Additional risks to our business relating to the COVID-19 pandemic include the following:• We have substantial debt outstanding currently, and our ongoing ability to service our significant financialobligations depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow from operations. Our cash flow from operations has been materially reduced as a result of the temporary suspension of operations and reduced occupancy at our resorts and willcontinue to be materially reduced as long as operations at some of our resorts remain suspended or opened resorts are operating at well-below historical levels. We cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations, thatfuture borrowings will be available to us under our revolving credit facility or otherwise, or that we will be able to complete any necessary financings or refinancings, in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay our debts and other obligations andfund our other liquidity needs; • The agreements which govern our various debt obligations impose restrictions on our business, including certaincovenants under our revolving credit facility which currently prevent additional draws on the facility and may materially impact our liquidity and financial condition and could require us to seek to meet capital needs through asset sales or dilutiveequity sales; • Adverse changes in our credit and any ratings could have an adverse impact on our interest expense;• Commercial airline service has been reduced or suspended to many of the regions in which our resorts are located.If scheduled airline service does not increase or return to normal levels once our resorts are re-opened it could have a material adverse effect on our resort revenues; • Safety protocols established by certain jurisdictions in which our resorts are located, for example, Jamaica,have made travel to our resorts in those jurisdictions more challenging and less attractive, adversely affecting demand at those resorts; • The economic fallout from the effects of the pandemic on the regions in which our resorts are located couldresult in increases in crime, theft, vandalism and other safety and health concerns in these areas that could directly impact our resorts or could result in the perception of such risks among prospective guests, which could lead to decreased futuredemand for our resorts; • We have been and may continue to be required to recognize significantnon-cash impairment charges as a result of material reductions in our cash flows from operations; • We may be subject to increased risks related to employee matters, including increased employment litigation andclaims for severance or other benefits tied to terminations or furloughs as a result of the suspension of operations at our resorts prompted by the effects of the pandemic; • We have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs related to sanitation and hygiene requirements,social distancing and other mitigation measures; • Steps to reduce costs may negatively impact our reputation and guest loyalty, and future demand at our resortsmay suffer as a result; • We may experience disruptions as a result of corporate employees working remotely, including risk ofcybersecurity incidents and disruptions to internal control procedures; and • In order to raise additional capital to fund our operations and service our indebtedness, we have sold assets andissued equity securities and we may need to sell further assets or issue additional equity securities in the future at prices that are below the value of those assets or that may be dilutive to existing shareholders and that may be below what webelieve to be the intrinsic value of our Ordinary Shares. Risks Related to this Offering The per share trading price and trading volume of our Ordinary Shares may be volatile following this offering. The per share trading price of our Ordinary Shares has in the past and may continue to be volatile. In addition, the trading volume in ourOrdinary Shares may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. If the per share trading price of our Ordinary Shares declines significantly, you may be unable to resell your shares at or above the purchase price. We cannot assure youthat the per share trading price of our Ordinary Shares will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future. Some of the factorsthat could negatively affect our share price or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our Ordinary Shares include: • the realization of any of the risk factors presented in this prospectus supplement and in our SEC filings;• actual or anticipated differences in our estimates, or in the estimates of analysts, for our revenues, AdjustedEBITDA, results of operations, level of indebtedness, liquidity or financial condition; • inability to raise capital in sufficient amounts when needed; • additions and departures of key personnel; • failure to comply with the requirements of the Nasdaq Global Select Market; • failure to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or other laws or regulations; • future issuances, sales or resales, or anticipated issuances, sales or resales, of our Ordinary Shares;• publication of research reports about us, our resorts, the all-inclusivesegment of the lodging industry or the lodging industry generally; • the performance and market valuations of other similar companies; • broad disruptions in the financial markets, including sudden disruptions in the equity or credit markets;• speculation in the press or investment community; • actual, potential or perceived control, accounting or reporting problems; • changes in accounting principles, policies and guidelines; • general economic and financial market conditions; and • persistence or expansion of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on thehospitality industry. In the past, securities class-action litigation has often been instituted against companiesfollowing periods of volatility in the market price of their shares. This type of litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on us. Future issuances of debt securities and equity securities may adversely affect us, including the market price of our Ordinary Shares and may be dilutiveto existing shareholders. Given the current materially adverse effects of the COVID-19pandemic on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, we continue to explore options to raise capital to fund our operations and service our indebtedness, including equity capital through a private placement or publicoffering. We have issued equity securities recently and in order to address liquidity issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic may be required to issue additional equity securities in the future at prices that may be dilutive to existing shareholdersand that may be below what we believe to be the intrinsic value of our Ordinary Shares. In the future, we may also incur debt or issueequity ranking senior to our Ordinary Shares. Those securities will generally have priority upon liquidation. Such securities also may be governed by an indenture or other instrument containing covenants restricting its operating flexibility.Additionally, any convertible or exchangeable securities that we issue in the future may have rights, preferences and privileges more favorable than those of our Ordinary Shares. Because our decision to issue debt or equity in the future will dependon market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing, nature or success of our future capital raising efforts. As a result, future capital raising efforts may reduce the market price of ourOrdinary Shares and be dilutive to existing shareholders. Dividends distributed by us, if any, on the Ordinary Shares to certain related parties inlow-taxed jurisdictions might in the future become subject to an additional Dutch withholding tax on dividends. We have not paid a dividend to our ordinary shareholders in the past, and we may not pay such dividends in the future, especially under currentconditions, but if we ever do, then under current law, dividends paid on the Ordinary Shares are in principle subject to Dutch dividend withholding tax at a rate of 15% under the Dutch Dividend Withholding Tax Act, unless a domestic or treatyexemption applies. In a letter to the Dutch parliament dated May 29, 2020, the Dutch State Secretary of Finance announced that the government intends to introduce an additional withholding tax on dividends paid (i) to group entities injurisdictions that have a corporate income tax rate below 9%, (ii) to group entities in jurisdictions that are included on the EU’s blacklist of non-cooperative jurisdictions or (iii) in certainabusive situations, effective January 1, 2024. On September 25, 2020, the Dutch government launched an internet consultation to provide interested parties the opportunity to respond to the draft legislative proposal to introduce theconditional withholding tax on dividends. Pursuant to the proposal published for consultation purposes, the conditional withholding tax on dividend payments will be implemented in the form of an amendment to the recently passed conditionalwithholding tax on interest and royalty payments pursuant to the Dutch Withholding Tax Act 2021 (Wet bronbelasting 2021), which act will become effective January 1, 2021. The proposal published for consultation purposes stipulates thatthe rate will be equal to the highest Dutch corporate income tax rate (currently 25%) at the time of the dividend payment. At the same time, the current Dutch dividend withholding tax regime is anticipated to remain in place. However, if thedividend withholding tax and the conditional withholding tax on dividends cumulate, the proposal published for consultation purposes stipulates that the conditional withholding tax will be reduced by the dividend withholding tax levied. As a result,if the shareholder being a related entity (A) is established or has a permanent establishment in a jurisdiction that has a corporate tax rate below 9% or in a jurisdiction included on the EU’s blacklist ofnon-cooperative jurisdictions, (B) is a hybrid entity or a reverse hybrid entity or (C) is interposed to avoid tax otherwise due by another entity, the tax rate on dividends distributed by us mayrise in the future from 15% to the highest corporate tax rate (currently 25%). The internet consultation closed on October 23, 2020. After the internet consultation, the Dutch government aims to prepare the final legislative proposal in early2021.

Our management may use the net proceeds for corporate purposes that may not improve our financialcondition or market value. The failure by management to apply these funds effectively could result in financial losses that couldhave a material adverse effect on our business, cause the price of our common stock to decline and delay the development and commercializationof our product candidates.You may experience immediate and substantialdilution.The offering priceper share in this offering may exceed the net tangible book value per share of our common stock outstanding prior to this offering.Assuming that an aggregate of 2,732,240 shares of our common stock are sold during the term of the sales agreement with B. RileySecurities and Needham  Company at a price of $9.15 per share, the last reported sale price of our common stock on the NYSEAmerican on November 25, 2020, for aggregate gross proceeds of $25 million, after deducting commissions and estimated aggregateoffering expenses payable by us, you will experience immediate dilution of $7.43 per share, representing the difference betweenour as-adjusted net tangible book value per share as of September 30, 2020, after giving effect to this offering and the assumedoffering price. The exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants may result in further dilution of your investment. Additionally,because the sales of shares of our common stock offered hereby will be made directly into the market, the prices at which we sellsuch securities will vary and these variations may be significant. As a result, you may suffer dilution if you purchase sharesin this offering at a higher price than other shares offered hereby are sold. See the section entitled “Dilution” belowfor a more detailed illustration of the dilution you would incur if you participate in this offering.You may experiencefuture dilution as a result of future equity offerings.We will need significantadditional funds for obtaining regulatory approval and commercialization of Defencath™ in the United States. In order toraise additional capital, we plan to offer in the future additional shares of our common stock or other securities convertibleinto or exchangeable for our common stock at prices that may not be the same as the price per share in this offering. We may sellshares or other securities in any other offering at a price per share that is less than the price per share paid by investors inthis offering, and investors purchasing shares or other securities in the future could have rights superior to existing stockholders.The price per share at which we sell additional shares of our common stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into commonstock, in future transactions may be higher or lower than the price per share paid by investors in this offering.USEOF PROCEEDSWe intend to use thenet proceeds of this offering for general corporate purposes, including obtaining regulatory approval and commercialization ofDefencath™ in the U.S., research and development, and working capital and capital expenditures.The amounts andtiming of our use of the net proceeds from this offering will depend on a number of factors, such as the timing and progressof our research and development efforts, the timing and progress of any collaborative or strategic partnering efforts, andthe competitive environment for our planned products. As of the date of this prospectus supplement, we cannot specify withcertainty all of the particular uses for the net proceeds to us from this offering. Accordingly, our management will havebroad discretion in the timing and application of these proceeds. Pending application of the net proceeds as described above,we intend to temporarily invest a portion of the proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing instruments.DILUTIONOur net tangible bookvalue as of September 30, 2020 was approximately $34.5 million, or $1.10 per share of common stock. Net tangible book value pershare is calculated by subtracting our total liabilities from our total tangible assets, which is total assets less intangibleassets, and dividing this amount by the number of shares of common stock outstanding. After giving effect to the sale by us ofthe full $25 million of common stock that may be offered in this offering at an assumed offering price of $9.15 per share, whichwas the closing price of our common stock on the NYSE American on November 25, 2020, and after deducting estimated offering commissionsand expenses payable by us, our as-adjusted net tangible book value as of September 30, 2020 would have been approximately $58.62million, or $1.72 per share of common stock. This represents an immediate increase in the net tangible book value of $0.62 pershare to our existing stockholders and an immediate and substantial dilution in net tangible book value of $7.43 per share to newinvestors. The following table illustrates this hypothetical per share dilution:Assumed public offering price per share$9.15Net tangible book value per share as of September 30, 2020$1.10Increase in net tangible book value per share attributable to this offering0.62As adjusted net tangible book value per share as of September 30, 2020, after giving effect to this offering1.72Dilution per share to new investors purchasing shares in this offering$7.43The table above assumesfor illustrative purposes that an aggregate of 2,732,240 shares of our common stock are sold at a price of $9.15 per share, thelast reported sale price of our common stock on the NYSE American on November 25, 2020, for aggregate gross proceeds of $25 million.The shares sold in this offering, if any, will be sold from time to time at various prices. An increase of $0.62 per share in theprice at which the shares are sold from the assumed offering price of $9.15 per share shown in the table above, assuming all ofour common stock in the aggregate amount of $25 million is sold at that price, would increase our adjusted net tangible book valueper share after the offering to $1.73 per share and would increase the dilution in net tangible book value per share to new investorsin this offering to $8.04 per share, after deducting commissions and estimated aggregate offering expenses payable by us. A decreaseof $0.62 per share in the price at which the shares are sold from the assumed offering price of $9.15 per share shown in the tableabove, assuming all of our common stock in the aggregate amount of $25 million is sold at that price, would decrease our adjustednet tangible book value per share after the offering to $1.71 per share and would decrease the dilution in net tangible book valueper share to new investors in this offering to $6.82 per share, after deducting commissions and estimated aggregate offering expensespayable by us. This information is supplied for illustrative purposes only.To the extent thatany outstanding options or warrants are exercised, new options are issued under our 2019 Stock Incentive Plan or we otherwise issueadditional shares of common stock in the future, there will be further dilution to new investors.The above discussionand table are based on 31,348,171 shares of our common stock outstanding as of September 30, 2020 and excludes the following securitiesoutstanding on September 30, 2020:●options to purchase an aggregate of 1,086,984 shares of our common stock issued to our officers,directors, employees and non-employee consultants under our 2019 Stock Incentive Plan, with a weighted average exercise price of$5.11 per share;●options to purchase an aggregate of 1,325,369 shares of our common stock issued to our officers,directors, employees and non-employee consultants under our 2013 Stock Incentive Plan, with a weighted average exercise price of$8.99 per share;●options to purchase an aggregate of 15,334 shares of our common stock issued to our officers, directors,employees and non-employee consultants under our 2006 Stock Plan, with a weighted average exercise price of $6.18 per share;●52,000 shares of Series C-3 Preferred Stock, which are convertible into 104,000 shares of commonstock;●89,623 shares of Series E Preferred Stock, which are convertible into 391,953 shares of commonstock;●100,000 shares of Series G Preferred Stock, which are convertible into 5,560,137 shares of common stock; ●45,326 shares of our common stock issuable in connection with our Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors, pursuant to which our non-employee directors may defer all of their cash director fees and restricted stock units; and●warrants to purchase an aggregate of 183,148 shares of common stock with a weighted average exercise price of $4.96 per share.PLANOF DISTRIBUTIONWe have entered intoan Amended and Restated At Market Issuance Sales Agreement referred to as the sales agreement, with B. Riley Securities, Inc. (formerlyknown as B. Riley FBR, Inc.), or. B. Riley Securities and Needham  Company, LLC, or Needham  Company, and together withB. Riley Securities, the sales agents. Pursuant to the sales agreement, we may issue and sell up to $25 million of our common stockfrom time to time through or to the sales agents, acting as sales agent or principal, subject to certain limitations, includingthe number or dollar amount of shares registered under the registration statement to which the offering relates.

The sales, if any, of shares made under the sales agreement will be made by any method that is deemed an “atthe market offering” as defined in Rule 415 promulgated under the Securities Act. We may instruct the sales agents not tosell common stock if the sales cannot be effected at or above the price designated by us from time to time. We or the sales agentsmay suspend the offering of common stock upon notice and subject to other conditions.Each time we wish toissue and sell common stock under the sales agreement, we will notify one designated sales agent of the number or dollar valueof shares to be issued, the dates on which such sales are anticipated to be made, any minimum price below which sales may not bemade and other sales parameters as we deem appropriate. Once we have so instructed such designated sales agent, unless such salesagent declines to accept the terms of the notice, such sales agent has agreed to use its commercially reasonable efforts consistentwith such agent’s normal trading and sales practices to sell such shares up to the amount specified on such terms. The obligationsof the sales agents under the sales agreement to sell our common stock is subject to a number of conditions that we must meet.We will pay the salesagents commissions for their services in acting as agents in the sale of common stock. Each sales agent will be entitled to a commissionequal to 3% of the gross proceeds from the sale of common stock offered hereby.

For a more complete understanding of our company andthe securities offered hereby, we encourage you to read and consider carefully the more detailed information in this prospectus,including the information incorporated by reference into this prospectus, and the information referred to under the heading “RiskFactors” in this prospectus beginning on page 9, and in the documents incorporated by reference into this prospectus.OURCOMPANYOverviewWeare a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing therapeutic products for the prevention and treatmentof infectious and inflammatory diseases.In late 2013, we met with the FDA todetermine the regulatory pathway for U.S. marketing approval of Defencath and began discussions on the clinical development program.In January 2015, the FDA granted Fast Track designation to Defencath, which is a program designed to facilitate development ofdrugs that are intended to treat serious and life-threatening conditions and to address an unmet medical need. Fast Track designationprovides eligibility to request Priority Review of the marketing application.Also, in January 2015, the FDA designatedDefencath as a Qualified Infectious Disease Product, or QIDP, which provides for an extension of five years of marketing exclusivityto be added to any exclusivity for which the application qualifies upon approval. For example, an additional five years of marketingexclusivity will be added to the five years granted to a New Chemical Entity, or NCE, upon approval of the New Drug Application,or NDA. QIDP designation also confers eligibility for Priority Review of the NDA.Welaunched the Phase 3 Prospective, Multicenter, Double-blind, Randomized, Active Control Study to Demonstrate Safety  Effectivenessof Defencath/Neutrolin in Preventing Catheter related Bloodstream Infection in Subjects on Hemodialysis for End Stage Renal Disease(LOCK-IT-100) in patients with hemodialysis catheters in the U.S. in December 2015. The clinical trial was designed to demonstratethe safety and effectiveness of Defencath compared to the standard of care CLS, Heparin, in preventing CRBSIs. The primary endpointfor the trial assessed the incidence of CRBSI and time to CRBSI for each study subject. Secondary endpoints were catheter patency,which was defined as required use of tissue plasminogen activating factor, or tPA, or removal of catheter due to dysfunction,and removal of catheter for any reason.InJuly 2018, 28 potential cases of CRBSI were identified in LOCK-IT-100 that occurred through early December 2017. As previouslyagreed with the FDA, an interim efficacy analysis was performed based on the first 28 cases. There was a highly statisticallysignificant 72% reduction in CRBSI by Defencath relative to the active control of Heparin (p=0.0034). Because the pre-specifiedlevel of statistical significance was reached for the primary endpoint and efficacy had been demonstrated with no safety concerns,the independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) recommended early termination.Followingdiscussions with the FDA, we proceeded with an orderly termination of LOCK-IT-100. The study had continued enrolling and treatingsubjects until study termination, and the final analysis was based on a total of 795 subjects.We remained blinded until the toplineresults of the full data set of LOCK-IT-100 were announced in late January 2019. In a total of 41 cases, there was a 71% reductionin CRBSI by Defencath relative to Heparin, which was highly statistically significant (p=0.0006), with a good safety profile.During 2019, we had a series of meetings with the FDA to discuss the analyses of data from LOCK-IT-100, including an end of Phase3 meeting, a pre-NDA meeting and a CMC meeting, in preparation for submission of the NDA.The FDA granted our request for a rollingsubmission and review of the NDA, which is designed to expedite the approval process for products being developed to address anunmet medical need. Although the FDA usually requires two pivotal clinical trials to provide substantial evidence of safety andeffectiveness for approval of an NDA, the FDA will in some cases accept one adequate and well-controlled trial, where it is alarge multicenter trial with a broad range of subjects and study sites that has demonstrated a clinically meaningful and statisticallyvery persuasive effect on a disease with potentially serious outcome. In March 2020, we began the modular submission process forthe NDA for Defencath for the prevention of CRBSI in hemodialysis patients, and recently announced on July 8, 2020, that submissionof all modules for the NDA was completed. In August 2020, the FDA accepted for filing the Defencath NDA and also granted our requestfor Priority Review. Priority Review provides for six-month review period instead of the standard ten-month review period, andFebruary 28, 2021 has been set as the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, date for the completion of the review for approvalof the NDA. The FDA noted that it is planning to hold an advisory committee meeting to discuss the application and that ithad not identified any potential review issues at this time. The meeting of the Antimicrobial Drugs Advisory Committee to discussthe Defencath NDA has tentatively been scheduled for January 14, 2021. We have not been informed of any delays by the FDA in thereview of the NDA, but the FDA has limited international and domestic travel due to COVID-19, and pre-approval inspections arerequired for manufacturing sites.The FDA also previously agreed that wecould request consideration of Defencath for approval under the Limited Population Pathway for Antibacterial and Antifungal Drugs,or LPAD. LPAD, passed as part of the 21st Century Cures Act, is a new program intended to expedite the development and approvalof certain antibacterial and antifungal drugs to treat serious or life-threatening infections in limited populations of patientswith unmet medical needs. Given that the LPAD pathway provides for a streamlined clinical development program for a limited populationthat may involve smaller, shorter, or fewer clinical trials, we believe that LPAD will provide additional flexibility for theFDA to approve Defencath to prevent CRBSIs in the limited population of adult patients with end stage renal disease receivinghemodialysis through a CVC.We were granted a deferral by the FDAunder the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA that requires sponsors to conduct pediatric studies for NDAs for a new activeingredient, such as taurolidine in Defencath, unless a waiver or deferral is obtained from the FDA. A deferral acknowledges thata pediatric assessment is required but permits the applicant to submit the pediatric assessment after the submission of an NDA.We have made a commitment to conduct the pediatric study after approval of the NDA for use in adult hemodialysis patients. Pediatricstudies for an approved product conducted under PREA may qualify for pediatric exclusivity, which if granted would provide anadditional six months of marketing exclusivity. Defencath would then have the potential to receive a total marketing exclusivityperiod of 10.5 years, including exclusivity pursuant to NCE and QIDP.We anticipate that Medicare reimbursementcould be available for Defencath in hemodialysis and other catheter indications in intensive care, oncology and TPN through relevanthospital inpatient diagnosis-related groups, or DRGs, or outpatient ambulatory payment classifications, or APCs, the EndStageRenal Disease Prospective Payment System, or ESRD PPS, base payment, or under the Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics,and Supplies, or DMEPOS, Fee Schedule, depending on the setting of care. We also plan to seek separate reimbursement as a drug,where available under Medicare, through mechanisms such as pass-through status under the Hospital Outpatient Prospective PaymentSystem, the transitional drug add-on payment adjustment, or TDAPA, under the ESRD PPS, or reimbursement as a drug used with aDMEPOS infusion pump. We have engaged U.S. Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services, or CMS, in preliminary discussions concerningthe reimbursement for Defencath under TDAPA; however, qualifications cannot be determined until after FDA approval and CMS evaluatesthe request for coverage in a quarterly review. If approved under TDAPA, reimbursement of Defencath would be calculated basedon its average selling price.Althoughwe cannot fully anticipate changes in reimbursement requirements and mechanisms in the coming years, we expect Defencath wouldbe eligible for and would obtain TDAPA. To be eligible for TDAPA, an innovative new renal drug or biologic must be, among otherthings, identified as having an end action effect that treats or manages a condition or conditions associated with ESRD and asnot fitting into an established ESRD PPS functional category. We believe that in addition to the Fast Track and QIDP designationsgranted by FDA, Defencath meets the criterion of being a new renal dialysis product used to treat or manage a condition associatedwith ESRD, since infections are the second leading cause of death in patients with ESRD and CVCs are a significant risk factorfor infection-associated mortality.InternationalIn the European Union, or EU, Neutrolinis regulated as a Class 3 medical device. In July 2013, we received CE Mark approval for Neutrolin. In December 2013, we startedcommercial sales of Neutrolin in Germany for the prevention of CRBSI and maintenance of catheter patency in hemodialysis patientsusing a tunneled, cuffed CVC for vascular access. To date, Neutrolin is registered and may be sold in certain European Union andMiddle Eastern countries for such treatment.In September 2014, the TUV-SUD and The Medicines EvaluationBoard of the Netherlands, or MEB, granted a label expansion for Neutrolin, to include use in oncology patients receiving chemotherapy,IV hydration and IV medications via CVC for the EU and in December 2014, we received approval from the Hessian District Presidentin Germany to expand the label for these same expanded indications. The expansion also adds patients receiving medication and IVfluids via CVC in intensive or critical care units (cardiac care unit, surgical care unit, neonatal critical care unit, and urgentcare centers). An indication for use in total parenteral nutrition was also approved.AdditionalDevelopment Possibilities Weintend to pursue additional indications for Defencath use as a CLS in populations with an unmet medical need that also representa significant market opportunity. For example, we intend to pursue marketing authorization in the U.S. for use as a CLS to reduceCRBSIs in oncology and total parenteral nutrition patients using a CVC.In addition to the CLS, we are sponsoringa pre-clinical research collaboration for the use of taurolidine as a possible treatment for pediatric tumors. In February 2018,the FDA granted orphan drug designation to taurolidine for the treatment of neuroblastoma in children. We may seek one or morestrategic partners or other sources of capital to help with the development and commercialization of taurolidine for the treatmentof neuroblastoma in children. We are also evaluating opportunities for the possible expansion of taurolidine as a platform compoundfor use in certain medical devices. Patent applications have been filed in several indications, including wound closure, surgicalmeshes, and wound management. Based on initial feasibility work, we are advancing pre-clinical studies for taurolidine-infusedsurgical meshes, suture materials and hydrogels. We will seek to establish development/commercial partnerships as these programsadvance.The FDA regards taurolidine as an NCEand therefore it is currently an unapproved new drug. We might in the future pursue product candidates that would involve devicesimpregnated with taurolidine, and we believe that at the current time such products would be combination products subject to devicepremarket submission requirements, while subject also, under review by FDA, to the standards for drug approvability. Consequently,given that there is no appropriate predicate medical device currently marketed in the U.S. on which a 510(k) approval processcould be based and that taurolidine is not yet approved in any application, we anticipate that we would be required to submita premarket approval application, or PMA, for marketing authorization for any medical device indications that we may pursue fordevices containing taurolidine. In the event that an NDA for Defencath is approved by the FDA, the regulatory pathway for thesemedical device product candidates may be revisited with the FDA. Although there may be no appropriate predicate, de novo ClassII designation can be proposed, based on a risk assessment and a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness.InDecember 2019, the novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, was identified in Wuhan, China. This virus has been declared a pandemicand has spread to multiple global regions. The outbreak and government measures taken in response have also had a significantimpact, both direct and indirect, on businesses and commerce, as worker shortages have occurred; supply chains have been disrupted;facilities and production have been suspended; and demand for certain goods and services, such as medical services and supplies,has spiked, while demand for other goods and services, such as travel, has fallen. In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, “shelterin place” orders and other public health guidance measures have been implemented across much of the United States, Europeand Asia, including in the locations of our offices, clinical trial sites, key vendors and partners. Our program timelines maybe negatively affected by COVID-19, which could materially and adversely affect business, financial conditions and results ofoperations.CorporateHistory and InformationWe were organized as a Delaware corporation on July 28, 2006under the name “Picton Holding Company, Inc.” and we changed our corporate name to “CorMedix Inc.” on January18, 2007.

These provisions are expected to encourage persons seeking to acquirecontrol of our Company to first negotiate with our Board of Directors. We believe that the benefits of increasing our abilityto negotiate with the proponent of an unfriendly or unsolicited proposal to acquire or restructure our Company outweigh the disadvantagesof discouraging these proposals because negotiation of these proposals could result in an improvement of their terms.DelawareAnti-takeover LawWeare subject to Section 203 of the DGCL, an anti-takeover law. In general, Section 203 prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporationfrom engaging in a “business combination” with an “interested stockholder” for a period of three yearsfollowing the date the person became an interested stockholder, unless:●the    Board of Directors approves the transaction in which the stockholder became an interested stockholder prior to the date the    interested stockholder attained that status;●when    the stockholder became an interested stockholder, he or she owned at least 85% of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding    at the time the transaction commenced, excluding shares owned by persons who are directors and also officers and certain shares    owned by employee benefits plans; or●on    or subsequent to the date the business combination is approved by the Board of Directors, the business combination is authorized    by the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3% of the voting stock of the corporation at an annual or special meeting of stockholders.Generally,a “business combination” includes a merger, asset or stock sale, or other transaction resulting in a financial benefitto the interested stockholder. Generally, an “interested stockholder” is a person who, together with affiliates andassociates, owns, or is an affiliate or associate of the corporation and within three years prior to the determination of interestedstockholder status did own, 15% or more of a corporation’s voting stock.Theexistence of Section 203 of the DGCL would be expected to have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions not approvedin advance by our Board of Directors, including discouraging attempts that might result in a premium over the market price forthe shares of our common stock.CharterDocumentsOurAmended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, and Second Amended and Restated Bylaws include a number of provisionsthat may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or delaying or preventing changes in control or management of our Company.First, our Second Amended and Restated Bylaws limit who may call special meetings of the stockholders, such meetings may onlybe called by the chairman of the Board of Directors, the chief executive officer, the Board of Directors or holders of an aggregateof at least 15% of our outstanding entitled to vote. Second, our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation does not includea provision for cumulative voting for directors. Under cumulative voting, a minority stockholder holding a sufficient percentageof a class of shares may be able to ensure the election of one or more directors. Third, our Second Amended and Restated Bylawsprovide that the number of directors on our Board of Directors, which may range from five to nine directors, shall be exclusivelyfixed by our Board of Directors, which has set the number of directors at seven. Fourth, newly created directorships resultingfrom any increase in our authorized number of directors and any vacancies in our Board of Directors resulting from death, resignation,retirement, disqualification or other cause (including removal from office by a vote of the shareholders) will be filled by amajority of our Board of Directors then in office. Finally, our Second Amended and Restated Bylaws establish procedures, including90-day advance notice requirement, with regard to the nomination of candidates for election as directors and stockholder proposals.These and other provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Second Amended and Restated Bylaws andDelaware law could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control or management ofour Company.DESCRIPTIONOF DEBT SECURITIESThefollowing description, together with the additional information we include in any applicable prospectus supplement, summarizesthe material terms and provisions of any debt securities that we may offer under this prospectus.

These risks and uncertainties are not the only ones facing us. There may be other risks that a prospective investor should considerthat are relevant to that investor’s own particular circumstances or generally. Risks Related to the Notes The notes will be effectively subordinated to our existing and future secured debt and the existing and future liabilities of our subsidiaries. The notes are our senior obligations and will rank equallyin right of payment with our other existing and future senior unsecured obligations. The notes will not be secured by any of our assets. Any future claims of our secured lenders with respect to assets securing their loans will be prior to any claimof the holders of the notes with respect to those assets. Holders of secured debt that we have now or may issue in the future may foreclose on the assets securing such debt, reducing the cash flow from the foreclosed property available for paymentof unsecured debt, including the notes. Holders of our secured debt also would have priority over unsecured creditors in the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation or similar proceeding to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such debt.As a result, the notes will be effectively subordinated to any secured debt that we may issue in the future to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such debt. Our operations are partially conducted through oursubsidiaries that are separate and distinct legal entities from us. Our subsidiaries have no obligation to pay any amounts due on the notes or to provide us with funds to meet our payment obligations on the notes, whether in the form of dividends,distributions, loans or other payments. In addition, any payment of dividends, loans or advances by our subsidiaries could be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions. Payments to us by our subsidiaries are contingent upon thesubsidiaries’ earnings, cash flow and other business considerations. Our right to receive any assets of any of our subsidiaries upon their bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization and, therefore, the right of the holders of the notes toparticipate in those assets will be effectively subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary’s creditors, including trade creditors. In addition, even if we are a creditor of any of our subsidiaries, our right as a creditor would besubordinated to any security interest in such assets of our subsidiaries and any indebtedness of our subsidiaries senior in right of payment to that held by us. At September 30, 2020, we had approximately $19 million of indebtednessoutstanding on a consolidated basis that would rank structurally senior to the notes and approximately $13,108 million of indebtedness outstanding on a consolidated basis that would rank equally with the notes. At September 30, 2020, on apro forma basis after giving effect to our entry into, and borrowing in full under, a $400 million term loan agreement on November 10, 2020, we had total debt of $13,527 million. We may issue additional notes. Under the terms of the Indenture that governs the notes, wemay from time to time without notice to, or the consent of, the holders of the notes, create and issue additional notes of a new or existing series, which notes, if of an existing series, will be equal in rank to the outstanding notes of that seriesin all material respects so that the new notes may be consolidated and form a single series with such notes and have the same terms and conditions as to status, redemption or otherwise (except for the issue date, the public offering price and, insome cases, the first interest payment date as described under “Description of the Notes—General”) as such notes. If the additional notes, if any, are not fungible with the notes offered hereby for U.S. federal income tax purposes,the additional notes will have a separate CUSIP number. Redemption may adversely affect your return on the notes. The notes are redeemable at our option and, therefore, wemay choose to redeem the notes at times when prevailing interest rates are relatively low. As a result, you may not obtain your expected return on the notes and may not be able to reinvest the proceeds received from a redemption of the notes in aninvestment that yields a comparable return. If active trading markets do not develop for the notes, you may be unable to sell your notes or to sell your notes at prices thatyou deem sufficient. The notes will be anew issue of securities for which there currently is no established trading market. We do not intend to list the notes on any national securities exchange. While the underwriters of the notes have advised us that they intend to make a market in thenotes, the underwriters will not be obligated to do so and may stop their market making at any time. No assurance can be given: • that a market for the notes will develop or continue; • as to the liquidity of any market that does develop; and • as to your ability to sell your notes or the prices at which you may be able to sell your notes. We may not be able to repurchase the notes upon achange of control. Upon the occurrenceof a Change of Control Repurchase Event, each holder of notes will have the right to require us to offer to repurchase all or any part of such holder’s notes for cash at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaidinterest, if any, to the date of such repurchase. If a Change of Control Repurchase Event occurs, there can be no assurance that we would have sufficient financial resources available to satisfy our obligations to repurchase the notes or that theterms of other indebtedness will not preclude us from doing so. Our failure to repurchase the notes as required under the Indenture governing the notes would result in a default under the Indenture, which could result in other defaults under our andour subsidiaries’ various debt agreements and other arrangements and have material adverse consequences for us and the holders of the notes. See “Description of the Notes—Repurchase at the Option of Holders Upon Change of ControlRepurchase Event.” An investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Before deciding whether to invest in our common stock, you shouldcarefully consider the risks described below and those discussed under the section titled “Risk Factors” contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,2019 as updated by our annual, quarterly and other reports and documents that are incorporated by reference into this prospectus, before deciding whether to purchase any of the securities being registered pursuant to the registration statement ofwhich this prospectus is a part. Each of the risk factors could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our securities, and the occurrence ofany of these risks might cause you to lose all or part of your investment. Such risks may be amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic and its potential impact on our business and the global economy.Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also significantly impair our business operations. Please also read carefully the section below titled “Special Note Regarding Forward-LookingStatements.” Risks Related to this Offering Our management might apply the net proceeds from this offering in ways with which you do not agree and in ways that may impair the valueof your investment. We currently intend to use the net proceeds from this offering primarily to fund the development of our drugcandidates and for working capital and general corporate purposes. We may also use the net proceeds from this offering for certain pre-commercialization activities and to acquire or invest inbusinesses, products or technologies that are complementary to our own, although we have no current plans, commitments or agreements with respect to any acquisitions as of the date of this prospectus. Pending the use of net proceeds from thisoffering as further described in the section titled “Use of Proceeds,” we intend to invest the net proceeds in short-term, investment-grade, interest bearing obligations, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of theUnited States. Our management has broad discretion as to the use of these proceeds and you will be relying on the judgment of our management regarding the application of these proceeds. We might apply these proceeds in ways with which you do notagree, or in ways that do not yield a favorable return. If our management applies these proceeds in a manner that does not yield a significant return, if any, on our investment of these net proceeds, it could compromise our ability to pursue ourgrowth strategy and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. You may experience future dilution as a result of futureequity offerings. We will require more capital to pursue our preclinical and clinical activities, regulatory approval and thecommercialization of our current or future drug candidates. In addition, we may also choose to raise additional capital due to market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or futureoperating plans. To raise additional capital, we may in the future offer additional shares of our common stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock at prices that may not be the same as the price per share inthis offering. We may sell shares or other securities in any other offering at a price per share that is less than the price per share paid by investors in this offering, and investors purchasing shares or other securities in the future could haverights superior to existing stockholders. The price per share at which we sell additional shares of our common stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into common stock, in future transactions may be higher or lower than the price per sharepaid by investors in this offering. It is not possible to predict the actual number of shares we will sell under the salesagreement, or the gross proceeds resulting from those sales. Subject to certain limitations in the sales agreement and compliancewith applicable law, we have the discretion to deliver instruction to Cowen to sell shares of our common stock at any time throughout the term of the sales agreement. The number of shares that are sold through Cowen after our instruction will fluctuate based on a number of factors, including the market price of our common stock during thesales period, the limits we set with Cowen in any instruction to sell shares, and the demand for our common stock during the sales period. Because the price per share of each share sold will fluctuate during this offering, it is not currentlypossible to predict the number of shares that will be sold or the gross proceeds to be raised in connection with those sales. Thecommon stock offered hereby will be sold in “at the market offerings,” and investors who buy shares at different times will likely pay different prices. Investors who purchase shares in this offering at different times will likely pay different prices, and so may experience different levels ofdilution and different outcomes in their investment results. We will have discretion, subject to market demand, to vary the timing, prices, and numbers of shares sold in this offering. In addition, subject to the final determination by our board ofdirectors, there is no minimum or maximum sales price for shares to be sold in this offering. Investors may experience a decline in the value of the shares they purchase in this offering as a result of sales made at prices lower than the prices theypaid. An investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. The prospectus supplement applicable to each offering of securities willcontain a discussion of the risks applicable to an investment in our securities. Prior to making a decision about investing in our securities, you should carefully consider the specific factors discussed under the heading “Risk Factors” inthe applicable prospectus supplement, together with all of the other information contained or incorporated by reference in the prospectus supplement or appearing or incorporated by reference in this prospectus. You should also consider the risks,uncertainties and assumptions discussed under Part II, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2020, which is incorporated herein byreference, and may be amended, supplemented or superseded from time to time by other reports we file with the SEC in the future. The risks and uncertainties we have described are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties notpresently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our operations. Investing in our ADSs involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risks and the risks described in our Annual Report onForm 20-F for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, together with all of the other information contained in this prospectus supplement, the accompanying prospectus and in our filings with theSecurities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, that we have incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, prospects, operating results andfinancial condition could suffer materially. In such event, the trading price of our ADSs could decline and you might lose all or part of your investment. Risks Related to this Offering and Ownership of ADSs The price of the ADSs has been, and is likely to continue to be, highly volatile, which could result in substantial losses for purchases of ADSs in thisoffering. The price of the ADSs has been, and is likely to continue to be, highly volatile. The stock market in general and the market for smallerpharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. As a result of this volatility, you may not be able to sell your ADSs ator above the public offering price and you may lose some or all of your investment. The market price for the ADSs may be influenced by many factors, including: • our ability to commercialize or obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, or delays incommercializing or obtaining regulatory approval; • announcements relating to our clinical trials, including any periodic updates relating to enrollment of trialsubjects, adverse events, site initiation and timing of release of interim analyses and final trial results; • commencement or termination of collaborations for our development programs; • failure or discontinuation of any of our development programs; • results from, or any delays in, clinical trials relating to our product candidates, including our clinical trialsfor elamipretide; • any need to suspend or discontinue clinical trials due to side effects or other safety risks, or any need toconduct studies on the long-term effects associated with the use of our product candidates; • manufacturing issues related to our product candidates for clinical trials or future products forcommercialization; • commercial success and market acceptance of our product candidates following regulatory approval;• undesirable side effects caused by product candidates after they have entered the market; • ability to discover, develop and commercialize additional product candidates; • announcements relating to collaborations that we may enter into with respect to the development orcommercialization of our product candidates; • success of our competitors in discovering, developing or commercializing products; • strategic transactions undertaken by us; • additions or departures of key personnel; • product liability claims related to our clinical trials or product candidates; • business disruptions caused by earthquakes or other natural disasters or a public health crisis (for example, anoutbreak of a contagious disease such as COVID-19); • disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights; • U.S. Food and Drug Administration, European Medicines Agency, China’s National Medical ProductsAdministration or other regulatory actions affecting us or our industry; • healthcare reform measures in the United States; • future sales or issuances of equity or debt securities by us; • fluctuations in our semi-annual operating results; • announcement or expectation of additional financing efforts; • sales of our Ordinary Shares by us, our insiders or other shareholders; • actual and anticipated variations in our results of operations; • changes in securities analysts’ estimates or market perception of our financial performance;• announcements by us of significant acquisitions, disposals, strategic alliances or joint ventures;• market developments affecting us or the markets in which we operate; • regulatory or legal developments, including litigation; • the operating and share price performance of companies that investors consider to be comparable to us;• the depth and liquidity of the market for the ADSs; • the release or expiry of lock-up or other transfer restrictions on ourOrdinary Shares and ADSs; • general economic, political and stock market conditions in the United States and the countries in which weoperate and elsewhere in the world; and • the other factors described in this “Risk Factors” section and the “Risk Factors” sections ofour Annual Report on Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, which areincorporated by reference herein. Additionally, in the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against acompany following a decline in the market price of its securities. This risk is especially relevant for us in light of the significant stock price volatility we and other pharmaceutical companies have experienced in recent years. If we face suchlitigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources, which could harm our business. Asignificant portion of our total outstanding shares may be sold into the market, which could cause the market price of the ADSs to decline significantly, even if our business is doing well. Sales of a substantial number of ADSs in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in the market that holders of ADSs intend tosell a significant amount of ADSs, could reduce the market price of the ADSs. After this offering, we will have 14,567,379 ADSs outstanding, based on the 140,675,196 Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs outstanding as of October 31, 2020.All ADSs we are selling in this offering may be resold in the public market immediately, unless purchased by our affiliates. On June 2, 2020, we entered into the Purchase Agreement with Lincoln Park pursuant to which Lincoln Park has committed to purchase up to$20.0 million of our ordinary shares. We generally have the right to control the timing and amount of any future sales of ordinary shares to Lincoln Park. Sales of ordinary shares, if any, to Lincoln Park will depend upon market conditions andother factors to be determined by us. We may ultimately decide to sell to Lincoln Park all, some or none of the additional ordinary shares that may be available for us to sell pursuant to the Purchase Agreement. Therefore, sales to Lincoln Parkcould result in substantial dilution to the interests of other holders of our ordinary shares. Additionally, the sale of a substantial number of ordinary shares to Lincoln Park, or the anticipation of such sales, could make it moredifficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and at a price that we might otherwise wish to effect sales. If and when we do sell ordinary shares to Lincoln Park, after Lincoln Park has acquired the ordinaryshares, Lincoln Park may resell all, some or none of those ordinary shares at any time or from time to time in its discretion. We have also registered88.5 million Ordinary Shares that we may issue under our equity compensation plans. These shares can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance and once vested, subject to volume limitations applicable to affiliates. We have broad discretion in the use of the net proceeds from this offering and may not use them effectively. Our management will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds from this offering and could spend the proceeds in ways that do not improveour results of operations or enhance the value of our ADSs. The failure by our management to apply these funds effectively could result in financial losses that could cause the price of our ADSs to decline and delay the development of our productcandidates. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on the ADSs in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, holders of ADSs must rely on capitalappreciation, if any, for any return on their investment. We have never declared nor paid cash dividends on our share capital. We currently planto retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the operation, development and growth of our business. In addition, the terms of our existing loan and security agreement preclude us from paying cash dividends without the consent of ourlender. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of the ADSs will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future. However, if we do pay a cash dividend on our Ordinary Shares in the future, we may only pay such dividend out of our profitsor share premium (subject to applicable solvency requirements) under Cayman Islands law. If you purchase ADSs in this offering, you will sufferimmediate dilution in the net tangible book value of your investment. The public offering price of the ADSs will be substantially higher than thenet tangible book value per ADS. Therefore, if you purchase ADSs in this offering, you will pay a price per ADS that substantially exceeds our net tangible book value per ADS after this offering. Based on the public offering price of $1.125 per ADS,you will experience immediate dilution of $1.031 per ADS, representing the difference between our as adjusted net tangible book value per ADS after giving effect to this offering and the public offering price. For a further description of thedilution that you will experience immediately after this offering, see “Dilution.” You may experience future dilution in your ownershipinterest as a result of future equity offerings. In order to raise additional capital, we may in the future offer additional ADSs or OrdinaryShares or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for ADSs or Ordinary Shares. We may sell securities in any other offering at effective prices that are less than the price paid by investors in this offering, and investors purchasingsecurities in the future could have rights superior to existing holders of ADSs. Morningside Venture (I) Investments Limited has a controllingownership interest in our Ordinary Shares and the ability to substantially control all matters submitted to shareholders for approval. As ofOctober 31, 2020, Morningside Venture (I) Investments Limited, or MVIL, beneficially owned 72.1% of our Ordinary Shares. In addition, certain entities associated within MVIL beneficially owned an additional 9.8% of our Ordinary Sharesas of October 31, 2020. As a result, MVIL and such entities are able to control all matters submitted to our shareholders for approval that require an ordinary resolution or special resolution, as well as ourmanagement and affairs. For example, MVIL would control the election of directors and approval of any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. This concentrationof ownership control may: • delay, defer or prevent a change in control; • entrench our management or the board of directors; or • impede a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us that other shareholders maydesire. MVIL owns a controlling portion of our Ordinary Shares and may have conflicts of interest with us and other shareholdersin the future. The interests of MVIL may not always be consistent with the interests of our company or of our other shareholders. Accordingly,MVIL could cause us to enter into transactions or agreements of which other holders of our Ordinary Shares would not approve or make decisions with which such holders would disagree. Gerald L. Chan, one of our directors, is a co-founder of the Morningside group, a private investment group with venture, private equity and property investments. In addition, Reenie McCarthy, our Chief Executive Officer and a director, served as a member ofthe investment team at Morningside Technology Advisory, LLC (and affiliates) from 1993 through 2016, and remains a director of Morningside Technology Advisory, LLC, which provides advisory services to entities associated with the Morningside group.Although Dr. Chan is not an officer, director or employee of MVIL and has neither voting nor dispositive control over the Ordinary Shares held byMVIL and does not otherwise beneficially own such shares, as a result of his ongoing relationship with the Morningside group, transactions between us and MVIL may present an actual or perceived conflict of interest. Although Ms. McCarthy is notan officer, director or employee of MVIL, and has neither voting nor dispositive control over our Ordinary Shares held by MVIL and does not otherwise beneficially own such shares, as a result of her historic relationship with the Morningside groupand her ongoing relationship with Morningside Technology Advisory, LLC, transactions between us and MVIL may present an actual or perceived conflict of interest. Any actual or perceived conflicts of interest may lead Dr. Chan andMs. McCarthy to recuse themselves from actions of our board of directors with respect to transactions involving MVIL and its affiliates. For example, in a situation in which MVIL is adverse to us, such as if it breaches an agreement with us, aconflict could arise. We may not be able to resolve any potential conflicts, and even if we do, the resolution may be less favorable than if we were dealing with an unaffiliated party. MVIL is in the business of making investments in companies and could from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete with us. MVIL mayalso pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and as a result, desirable acquisitions may not be available to us. So long as MVIL continues to own a significant amount of our equity, it will continue to be able tostrongly influence or effectively control our decisions. Beforepurchasing our common stock you should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below and under the heading “Risk Factors”included in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, as updated by our recent Form 8-K Report filed with the Securities andExchange Commission on May 8, 2020, as revised or supplemented by our subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, each of whichare on file with the SEC and are incorporated herein by reference, as well as all other information contained in this prospectussupplement and the accompanying prospectus and incorporated by reference and any free writing prospectus that we have authorizedfor use in connection with this offering. The risks and uncertainties described below and in our most recent Annual Report onForm 10-K, as revised or supplemented by our subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, are not the only risks and uncertaintieswe face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair ourbusiness operations. If any of the risks described below or in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, as revised or supplementedby our subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operationscould suffer. As a result, the trading price of our stock could decline, perhaps significantly, and you could lose all or partof your investment. The risks discussed below and in most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, as revised or supplemented by oursubsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, also include forward-looking statements and our actual results may differ substantiallyfrom those discussed in these forward-looking statements. See the section entitled “Forward-Looking Information.”RisksRelated To Our Financial Condition and Need For Additional CapitalWehave incurred significant losses since our inception and expect to continue to experience losses for the foreseeable future.Wehave incurred significant net losses and negative cash flow in each year since our inception, including net losses of approximately $22.0 million and $12.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019, respectively, and approximately$15.6 million and $11.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, and 2018, respectively. As of September 30, 2020, our accumulateddeficit was approximately $150.0 million. We have devoted a significant amount of our financial resources to research and development,including our nonclinical development activities and clinical trials. We expect that the costs associated with our plans to beginpreclinical research, contract manufacturing and file an IND for our TerraCoV2 vaccine product candidate and the research anddevelopment of our product candidates pursuant to our exclusive channel partnerships with Eleszto Genetika, Inc. (an assigneeof Precigen) in the area of lantibiotics (“Lantibiotics Program”) will continue to increase the level of our overallexpenses significantly going forward. Additionally, our NIAID license also requires the payment of certain recurring and performance-basedroyalties that may negatively impact our financial capabilities. As a result, we expect to continue to incur substantial net lossesand negative cash flow for the foreseeable future. These losses and negative cash flows have had, and will continue to have, anadverse effect on our shareholders’ equity and working capital. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associatedwith product development and commercialization, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of substantial expensesor when, or if, we will be able to generate the revenue necessary to achieve or maintain profitability.S-9Wewill need to raise additional capital in the future to complete the development and commercialization of our product candidatesand operate our business.Developingand commercializing biopharmaceutical products, including conducting nonclinical studies and clinical trials and establishingmanufacturing capabilities, and the progress of our efforts to develop and commercialize our product candidates, including ouracquisition of a vaccine product candidate is expensive, and can cause us to use our limited, available capital resources fasterthan we currently anticipate. We anticipate that our cash resources as of September 30, 2020, together with the proceeds fromrecent warrant exercises, will be sufficient to fund our operations as presently structured into the first quarter of 2021. Ouractual costs may ultimately vary from our current expectations, which could materially impact our use of capital and our forecastof the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations. Our current cash, cashequivalents and short-term investments are not sufficient to fully implement our business strategy and sustain our operations.Accordingly, we will need to seek additional sources of financing and such additional financing may not be available on favorableterms, if at all. Until we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenue, if ever, we expect to finance future cash needsthrough public or private equity offerings, debt financings or corporate or government collaboration and licensing arrangements.If we do not succeed in raising additional funds on acceptable terms, we may be unable to complete existing nonclinical and plannedclinical trials or obtain approval of our product candidates from the FDA and other regulatory authorities. We expect capitaloutlays and operating expenditures to increase over the next several years as we expand our infrastructure, and research and developmentactivities. Specifically, we need to raise additional capital to, among other things:●conduct                                                                              preclinical research for our TerraCoV2 vaccine product candidate, file an IND with the FDA and, if approved, engage in Phase                                                                              1 clinical trials;●engage    in GMP and non-GMP manufacturing for our product candidates at the preclinical research and clinical trial stages;●expand    our clinical laboratory operations;●fund    our clinical validation study activities;●expand    our research and development activities; and●finance    our capital expenditures and general and administrative expenses.Ourpresent and future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including:●the                                         current and continued microeconomic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our ability,                                         the ability of our third-party contractors and suppliers to meet our development needs,                                         and the ability of government regulators to conduct ordinary business operations in a                                         timely and efficient manner, as well as the pandemic’s broader, macroeconomic impact                                         on the U.S., foreign and global economic markets;●the                                                                              level of research and development investment budgeted to develop our current and future product candidates through each phase                                                                              of development;●costs    of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights;●our    need or decision to acquire or license complementary technologies or acquire complementary businesses;●changes    in test development plans needed to address any difficulties in product candidate selection for commercialization;●competing    technological and market developments;●our    interaction and relationship with the FDA, or other, regulatory agencies; and●changes    in regulatory policies or laws that affect our operations.Additionalcapital may not be available on satisfactory terms, or at all. Furthermore, if we raise additional funds by issuingequity securities, dilution to our existing stockholders could result. Any equity securities issued also may provide for rights,preferences or privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. If we raise additional funds by issuing debt securities,these debt securities would have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock, and the termsof the debt securities issued could impose significant restrictions on our operations. If we raise additional funds through collaborationsand licensing arrangements, we might be required to relinquish significant rights to our technologies or our products under developmentor grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us, which could lower the economic value of those programs to us. If adequatefunds are not available, we may have to scale back our operations or limit our research and development activities, which maycause us to grow at a slower pace, or not at all, and our business could be adversely affected.S-10Inaddition, we could be forced to discontinue product development and commercialization of one or more of our product candidates,curtail or forego sales and marketing efforts, and/or forego licensing attractive business opportunities.RisksRelating to this OfferingThemarket price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be volatile and fluctuate significantly, which could result insubstantial losses for investors.Thetrading price for our common stock has been, and we expect it to continue to be, volatile. The price at which our common stocktrades depends upon a number of factors, including our historical and anticipated operating results, our financial situation,announcements by us or our competitors, our ability or inability to raise the additional capital we may need and the terms onwhich we raise it, and general market and economic conditions. Some of these factors are beyond our control. Broad market fluctuationsmay lower the market price of our common stock and affect the volume of trading in our stock, regardless of our financial condition,results of operations, business or prospects. The closing price of our common stock as reported on the NYSE American had a highprice of $1.05 and a low price of $0.36 in the 52-week period ended December 31, 2019 and a high price of $1.49 and a low priceof $0.39 from January 1, 2020 through September 30, 2020. Among the factors that may cause the market price of our common stockto fluctuate are the risks described in this “Risk Factors” section and other factors, including:●results    of preclinical and clinical studies of our product candidates or those of our competitors;●regulatory    or legal developments in the U.S. and other countries, especially changes in laws and regulations applicable to our product    candidates;●actions    taken by regulatory agencies with respect to our product candidates, clinical studies, manufacturing process or sales and    marketing terms;●introductions    and announcements of new products by us or our competitors, and the timing of these introductions or announcements;●announcements    by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions or other strategic transactions or capital commitments;●fluctuations    in our quarterly operating results or the operating results of our competitors;●variance    in our financial performance from the expectations of investors;●changes    in the estimation of the future size and growth rate of our markets;●changes    in accounting principles or changes in interpretations of existing principles, which could affect our financial results;●failure    of our products to achieve or maintain market acceptance or commercial success;●conditions    and trends in the markets we serve;●changes    in general economic, industry and market conditions;●changes    in legislation or regulatory policies, practices or actions;S-11●the    commencement or outcome of litigation involving our company, our general industry or both;●recruitment    or departure of key personnel;●changes    in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of additional debt;●actual    or expected sales of our common stock by our stockholders;●acquisitions    and financings; and●the    trading volume of our common stock.Inaddition, the stock markets, in general, NYSE American and the market for biotech companies in particular, may experience a lossof investor confidence. Such loss of investor confidence may result in extreme price and volume fluctuations in our common stockthat are unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of our business, financial condition or results of operations.These broad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our common stock and expose us to securities classaction litigation. Such litigation, even if unsuccessful, could be costly to defend and divert management’s attention andresources, which could further materially harm our financial condition and results of operations.Ifyou purchase shares of our common stock sold in this offering, you will experience immediate and substantial dilution in the nettangible book value of your shares. In addition, we may issue additional securities in the future, which may result in additionaldilution to investors.Theoffering price per share of common stock in this offering is considerably more than the net tangible book value per share of ouroutstanding common stock. As a result, investors purchasing shares of common stock in this offering will pay a price per sharethat substantially exceeds the value of our tangible assets after subtracting liabilities. Investors will incur immediate dilutionof $0.18 per share, based on the public offering price of $0.37 per share and the net tangible book value as ofSeptember 30, 2020. For a more detailed discussion of the foregoing, see the section entitled “Dilution” below. Tothe extent outstanding stock options and warrants are exercised, or convertible preferred stock converted, there will be furtherdilution to new investors. In addition, to the extent we need to raise additional capital in the future and we issue additionalequity or convertible debt securities, our then existing shareholders may experience dilution and the new securities may haverights senior to those of our common stock offered in this offering.Ourmanagement team may invest or spend the proceeds of this offering in ways with which you may not agree or in ways which may notyield a significant return.Ourmanagement will have broad discretion over the use of proceeds from this offering. We intend to use the net proceeds from thisoffering to fund of our Terra CoV-2 research and clinical trials for working capital and general corporate purposes. Our managementwill have considerable discretion in the application of the net proceeds, and you will not have the opportunity, as part of yourinvestment decision, to assess whether the proceeds are being used appropriately. The net proceeds may be used for corporate purposesthat do not increase our operating results or enhance the value of our common stock.Futuresales of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to fall.Themarket price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market,or the perception that these sales could occur. In addition, these factors could make it more difficult for us to raise fundsthrough future offerings of common stock. We have recently issued a significant number of shares of common stock and the numberof outstanding shares has increased from 2,738,283 shares as of December 31, 2012 to 61,004,917 as of November 6, 2020. In addition,there were 16,017,133.483 shares of our Preferred stock outstanding which are convertible into shares of our common stock andwarrants to purchase an additional 20,513,145 shares of our common stock issuable upon exercise of warrants to investors. Therewere also 5,801,349 shares issuable upon exercise of options outstanding and an additional 2,207,901 shares available for optiongrants under our 2012 Equity Incentive Plan.S-12Theissuance of shares of our common stock under our 2012 Equity Incentive Plan is covered by Form S-8 registration statements wefiled with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, and upon exercise of the options, such shares may be resold into themarket. We have also issued shares of common stock and warrants in connection with previous private placements. Such shares areavailable for resale as well as certain of the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants. We have also issuedshares of our common stock in the private placement and financing transaction, which are deemed to be “restricted securities,”as that term is defined in Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or Securities Act, and such sharesmay be resold pursuant to the provisions of Rule 144. For example, on June 30, 2016 we issued 904,568 restricted sharesof our common stock to three accredited investors (Precigen, the KFLP and our Chairman Dr. Telling) in a private placement. Theresale of shares acquired from us in private transactions could cause our stock price to decline significantly. In addition, theconversion of outstanding shares of Series A and Series B convertible preferred stock issued in 2017 private placements into commonstock and the subsequent sale of shares of common stock could also cause our stock price to decline significantly.Inaddition, from time to time, certain of our shareholders may be eligible to sell all or some of their restricted shares of commonstock by means of ordinary brokerage transactions in the open market pursuant to Rule 144, subject to certain limitations. Ingeneral, pursuant to Rule 144, after satisfying a six-month holding period: (i) affiliated shareholders, or shareholders whoseshares are aggregated, may, under certain circumstances, sell within any three-month period a number of securities which doesnot exceed the greater of 1% of the then-outstanding shares of common stock or the average weekly trading volume of the classduring the four calendar weeks prior to such sale and (ii) non-affiliated shareholders may sell without such limitations, in eachcase provided we are current in our public reporting obligations. Rule 144 also permits the sale of securities by non-affiliatesthat have satisfied a one-year holding period without any limitation or restriction.Weare unable to estimate the number of shares that may be sold because this will depend on the market price for our common stock,the personal or business circumstances of sellers and other factors.Wecannot assure you that we will continue to be listed on the NYSE American.Ourcommon stock commenced trading on the NYSE American (formerly the NYSE MKT) on April 10, 2013, and we are subject to certain NYSEAmerican continued listing requirements and standards. We may also incur costs that we have not previously incurred for expensesfor compliance with the rules and requirements of the NYSE American. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to continueto satisfy the requirements of the NYSE American’s continued listing standards.Adelisting of our common stock from the NYSE American could negatively affect the price and liquidity of our common stock and couldimpair our ability to raise capital in the future.Ifour common stock is not listed on a national securities exchange, U.S. holders of warrants may not be able to exercise their warrantswithout compliance with applicable state securities laws and the value of your warrants may be significantly reduced.Ifour common stock is delisted from the NYSE America and is not eligible to be listed on another national securities exchange, theexercise of the warrants by U.S. holders may not be exempt from state securities laws. As a result, depending on the state ofresidence of a holder of the warrants, a U.S. holder may not be able to exercise its warrants unless we comply with any statesecurities law requirements necessary to permit such exercise or an exemption applies. Although we plan to use our reasonableefforts to assure that U.S. holders will be able to exercise their warrants under applicable state securities laws if no exemptionexists, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so. As a result, in the event that our common stock is delisted fromthe NYSE American and is not eligible to be listed on another securities exchange, your ability to exercise your warrants maybe limited. The value of the warrants may be significantly reduced if U.S. holders are not able to exercise their warrants underapplicable state securities laws.S-13Aninvestment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. Before making any investment decision, you should carefully considerthe risk factors set forth in this prospectus supplement, the accompanying prospectus and the information incorporated by referenceherein and therein, including under the caption “Risk Factors” in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and oursubsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, which are incorporated by reference in this prospectus, as well as in any applicableprospectus supplement, as updated by our subsequent filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “ExchangeAct”).Theserisks could materially affect our business, results of operation or financial condition and affect the value of our securities.Additional risks and uncertainties that are not yet identified may also materially harm our business, operating results and financialcondition and could result in a complete loss of your investment. You could lose all or part of your investment. For more information,see “Where You Can Find More Information.”Risks Relatedto This Offering Managementwill have broad discretion as to the use of the proceeds from this offering, and we may not use the proceeds effectively. Subjectto certain limited exceptions set forth in the offering documents, we have agreed to use the net proceeds from this offering solelyfor general corporate purposes. Our management will have significant flexibility in applying the net proceeds of this offeringfor general corporate purposes. You will be relying on the judgment of our management with regard to the use of these net proceeds,and subject to any agreed upon contractual restrictions under the terms of the subscription agreements, you will not have theopportunity, as part of your investment decision, to assess whether the proceeds are being used appropriately. It is possiblethat the net proceeds will be invested in a way that does not yield a favorable, or any, return for us. The failure of our managementto use such funds effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results andcash flow.You willexperience immediate dilution in the book value per share of the common stock you purchase. Becausethe price per share of our Common Stock being offered is higher than the book value per share of our Common Stock, you will suffersubstantial dilution in the net tangible book value of the common stock you purchase in this offering. Based on the offering priceof $14.50 per Share, if you purchase the Shares offered in this offering, you will suffer immediate and substantial dilution perShare in the net tangible book value of the common stock.There isno public market for the warrants to purchase common stock in this offering. Thereis no established public trading market for the Warrants being sold in this offering, and we do not expect a market to develop.In addition, we do not intend to apply to list the Warrants on any securities exchange. Without an active market, the liquidityof the warrants will be limited.Futuresales or other dilution of our equity could depress the market price of our Common Stock. Salesof our Common Stock, preferred stock, warrants, debt securities or any combination of the foregoing in the public market, or theperception that such sales could occur, could negatively impact the price of our Common Stock. We have a number of institutionaland individual shareholders that own significant blocks of our Common Stock. If one or more of these shareholders were to selllarge portions of their holdings in a relatively short time, for liquidity or other reasons, the prevailing market price of ourCommon Stock could be negatively affected.Wemay need to seek additional capital.

While it has received the required clearance from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for its two electricvehicle (EV) models – the K23 and K27 – via Certificates of Conformity; the sale of such EVs into the U.S. market isconditioned upon the satisfaction of the safety standards set by the United States Department of Transportation and the completionof the feature modification, software and technology upgrades catering for our potentioal U.S. costomers. Thus, no units of electricvehicles have been sold in the U.S.as of the date of this prospectus supplement. While we plan to apply a portion of our offeringproceeds into this segement, there is no assurance all conditions for the sale of EVs in the U.S. could be satisifed as planned.USE OF PROCEEDSWeestimate that the net proceeds we will receive from this offering will be $94,999,127, after deducting placement agent cash commissionand estimated offering expenses of approximately $200,900. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock issuableupon exercise of the Warrants that we are offering unless and until such Warrants are exercised.Ifall of the Warrants (warrants to purchase 3,805,312 Shares, including the Placement Agent warrant to purchase 265,487 Shares) issuedin connection with the closing are fully exercised for cash, we would receive additional aggregate proceeds of $55,177,024.Weintend to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes and working capital, including including researchand development and expenditures necessary to assure that our EV models comply with all necessary requirements for the entry intothe U.S. market, general and administrative expenses, and potential ordinary course acquisitions of technologies that complementour business. In the Securities Purchase Agreement we have entered into with the institutional investors in this offering, we have,subject to certain exceptions, specifically agreed not to use the proceeds of this offering to satisfy any existing debt (otherthan ordinary course trade payables), to redeem any of our outstanding securities, or to settle any litigation. We may segregatea small portion of the proceeds from this offering for the purpose of indemnification of the Placement Agent.Wehave not specifically identified the precise amounts we will spend on each of these areas or the timing of these expenditures.The amounts actually expended for each purpose may vary significantly depending upon numerous factors, including assessments ofpotential market opportunities and competitive developments. In addition, expenditures may also depend on the establishment ofnew collaborative arrangements with other companies, the availability of other financing, and other factors. Subject to any agreedupon contractual restrictions under the terms of the purchase agreement, our management will have some discretion in the applicationof the net proceeds from this offering. Our stockholders may not agree with the manner in which our management chooses to allocateand spend the net proceeds. Moreover, our management may use the net proceeds for purposes that may not result in our being profitableor increase our market value.DESCRIPTIONOF THE SECURITIES Inthis offering, we are offering a 8,849,560 units, which consists of 8,849,560 Shares and Investors Warrants to purchase, in theaggregate, an additional 3,539,825 shares of our common stock.TheShares and Investors Warrants will be sold together as a unit consisting of one Share and a Warrant (to purchase 0.40 shares ofour common stock for each Share included in the unit).Weare offering the units at a purchase price of $11.30 per unit.

(“Kandi Technologies”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on March31, 2004. As used herein, the terms “Company” or “Kandi” refer to Kandi Technologies and its operatingsubsidiaries, as described below.Headquartered in Jinhua City, Zhejiang Province,People’s Republic of China (“China” or “PRC”), the Company is one of China’s leading producersand manufacturers of electric vehicle (“EV”) products (through Kandi Electric Vehicles Group Co., Ltd. (the “AffiliateCompany”), formerly defined as the JV Company), EV parts, and off-road vehicles for sale in the Chinese and the global markets.The Company conducts its primary business operations through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Zhejiang Kandi Vehicles Co., Ltd. (“KandiVehicles”), Kandi Vehicles’ wholly and partially-owned subsidiaries, and SC Autosports LLC (“SC Autosports”,d/b/a Kandi America).Our OrganizationalStructureTheCompany’s organizational chart as of the date of this registration statement is as follows:Industry OverviewOverthe years, governments and the automobile manufacturing industry have reached a consensus on the importance of diversifying theautomobile industry and utilizing various energy resources. China is one of the world’s largest automobile markets. Chinahas relatively scarce fuel reserves but rich natural resources of electric power. As a result, the Chinese government has beenimplementing industrial policies of supporting new energy vehicles. The diversified market with the coexistence of traditionalfuel vehicles, plug-in hybrid vehicles and pure electric vehicles has been initially formed. We believe China is the most prospectivemarket for pure electric vehicles. According to a government forecast, China’s new energy vehicle sales are projected togrow to 2.1 million units in 2020, and its penetration is expected to reach 7% by 2020. We also believe that in the global automobileindustry, there is great development space for the Chinese electric vehicle and core parts industry in the future.InDecember 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (“COVID-19”), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus,was first found in Wuhan, China. The World Health Organization (“WHO”) declared the outbreak to be a Public HealthEmergency of International Concern on January 30, 2020 and recognized it as a pandemic on March 11, 2020. COVID-19 has had a significantimpact on the global economy and many industries, including the automobile and parts industry. However, as the outbreak in Chinahas been gradually managed under control, the automobile and parts industry has also begun to resume productions. Stimulated bythe various preferential policies of the Chinese government to promote economic development, we believe the automobile and itsparts industry will return onto the track for the next development.Asone of the pioneers in China’s electric vehicle industry, Kandi has spent years in the innovation of the new energy vehicletechnology research and development, production layout and market promotion mode, Kandi has successfully taken its position inChina’s electric vehicle industry, especially in the areas of the production and manufacturing of electric vehicles andcore parts.Competitive LandscapeIngeneral, our EV business faces competition from two groups of competitors: traditional vehicle manufacturers and new market entrants.Interms of competition with conventional fuel vehicle manufacturers, many of the conventional fuel vehicle manufacturers are muchlarger in terms of size, manufacturing capabilities, customer bases, financial, marketing and human resources than the electricvehicle manufacturers. However, the conventional fuel automobiles face many challenges, including but not limited to environmentalpollution and energy scarcity, which in turn provide great opportunities for the rapid development of the EV industry in China.OnMarch 31, 2020, in order to promote automobile consumption, the executive meeting of the State Council decided to extend two preferentialpolicies of new energy vehicle purchase subsidy and vehicle purchase tax exemption for another two years, which were originallydue at the end 2020. The Chinese government has released various national policies to promote the high-quality development ofthe electric vehicle industry with goals to facilitate the transformation and upgrading of the automobile industry, to improvethe comprehensive competitiveness of the electric vehicle industry, to support the electric vehicle and its core parts industry,to accelerate the resumption of production, and to promote the automobile consumption to cope with the impact of COVID-19 on thenational economy.Our Opportunitiesand Growth StrategyLocalgovernments in China are pushing for new electric vehicle adoption with strong policy support, due to worsening air pollutionand concerns about petroleum resource dependence. As one of the beneficiaries of the new energy vehicle industry take-off, Kandihas become one of the front runners in China’s electric vehicle industry, given its technology innovation with integratedsolutions and operation experience.Ourbusiness strategy includes efforts to provide customers with high-quality products, to expand our footprint in new and existingmarkets, and to advance our profile and the market demand through the further innovations in the Car- Share Program and the AffiliateCompany’s direct sales channel. We also provide EV products to end users through our distributors. We anticipate that ourpure EV product business in China, through the operations of the Affiliate Company and with the support of new Chinese governmentpolicies (including the Double Credit System Policy), will continue to develop and grow in the future. China promulgated the DoubleCredit System Policy in 2017, which assesses carmakers in terms of both fuel consumption and new energy vehicle production. Wecan amass credits by producing gasoline vehicles with less emissions than the country’s standards or by producing electriccars, plug-in hybrids and fuel cell vehicles.Today, cities in China face four criticalchallenges in the traffic environment, including pollution, traffic congestion, insufficient parking availability, and growingscarcity of energy supplies, which are mainly the result of ever-growing volume of gas-powered private cars. The best solutionto these problems is to increase more affordable public transportation for urban residents. Subway and bus used to be the mostpopular public transportation options in China. They form the main artery of urban public transportation, but such system is lackof capillary. In this regard, we introduced the Car-Share Program by using pure electric vehicles. Urban public transportationsystem can be improved with the Online Ride Sharing Service (“ORSS”) program.In order to further improve the Car-ShareProgram, we united other operators in more than 10 cities to form of a five-year 300,000 units online ride-sharing service allianceat the beginning of 2019. As one of the most active practitioners of sharing economy model in China nowadays, this innovativebusiness model provides an excellent solution to EV sharing. The character of this program is that all the cars casted to theonline platform by the alliance use the changing-battery-model. The changing battery model solves the problems including highprice of EVs, short recharging mileage, long recharging time, shortage of charging facilities, battery attenuation and potentialpollution problem and so on. Furthermore, this model allows the battery to be slowly recharged at a constant temperature, whichprolongs the usage life of the battery and truly realize green energy efficiency. We have reason to believe that this upgradeto ORSS program from Micro Public Transportation, or MPT advocated and practiced by Kandi will become the benchmark of urban car-shareand play a significant role in the development of China’s urban travel ecosphere.SC Autosports, LLC (“SC Autosports”,d/b/a Kandi America) is a Dallas-based sales company with nationwide sales channels in the U.S that is primarily engaged in thewholesale of off-road vehicle products, with a small percentage of its business derived from off-road vehicle parts wholesale andretail.

Before you decide to invest, we recommend that you carefully consider the followingrisk factors. Risks Relating to Economic Conditions and Other Factors Adverse events arising from the global Coronavirus outbreak could result in delays in payment or losses on your notes. The current outbreak of a new strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) has spreadthroughout the world, including in the United States. The outbreak has been declared to be a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization, and the president of the United States has made an emergencydeclaration under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act. A significant number of countries and the majority of state governments in the United States have also made emergency declarations related to the outbreakand have attempted to slow community spread of the virus by providing social distancing guidelines, issuing stay-at-home orders and mandating the closure of certain non-essential businesses. The outbreak has led, and will likely continue to lead, to disruptions in global financial markets and the economies of many nations and is resulting in adverse impacts on the economy ofthe United States (which include a general reduction in business activity and a significant increase in unemployment) and the global economy in general.The long-term impacts of the social, economic and financial disruptions caused by the outbreak of COVID-19 areunknown. While the U.S. Federal Reserve has implemented emergency interest rate cuts and liquidity programs for businesses and financial markets and the United States government and other governments have implemented other measures and stimulusplans in response to concerns surrounding the economic effects of the outbreak, the likelihood of such measures calming the volatility in the financial markets or preventing the occurrence of a longer-term national or global economic downturn cannotbe predicted. The United States economy has entered into a recession as a result of the outbreak and it is unclear how prolonged or severe this recession will be or how many lessees have been and will continue to be adversely affected bythe outbreak and related efforts by the Federal government and state governments to slow the spread of COVID-19 throughout the nation. In many jurisdictions, automotive dealers were required (or elected) totemporarily close or restrict their operations, and, even for dealerships that remained open or have subsequently reopened, consumer demand for automobiles has declined. As a result, VW Credit experienced and continues to experience a decline in theorigination of auto leases. As discussed under “—Recent economic developments may adversely affect the performance of the leases, which could result in losses on your notes,” these occurrences could have a negative impact onthe ability of lessees to meet their payment obligations under the leases and may result in increased losses on the notes.Additionally, the continued spread of COVID-19 may ultimately result in staffing problems in various industries andbusinesses if staff members become ill or seek to avoid becoming ill as various governmental authorities have urged non-essential employees to stay home. Many businesses are reviewing and adjusting theirbusiness continuity plans (or have implemented their business continuity plans) to change how and from where their staff members work in light of the outbreak. Those staffing problems and adjustments could cause changes in historical lesseebehavior, potentially resulting in less timely payments on the leases or delayed or reduced demand for the related vehicles. Consequently, the ability of VW Credit, as sponsor and servicer, or the other transaction parties,to perform their respective obligations under the transaction documents could be diminished by regulatory actions related to the outbreak and disruptions in the economy and the financial markets. The economic and operational impact of the outbreakcould adversely affect the business of VW Credit as discussed under “—Adverse events with respect to VW Credit or its affiliates or third party providers to whom VW Credit outsources its activities could affect the timing of payments onyour notes or have other adverse effects on your notes”. Further, certaingovernmental authorities, including Federal, state or local governments, could enact, and in some cases already have enacted, laws, regulations, executive orders or other guidance that allow lessees to defer scheduled payments, require modificationsto the leases, or preclude creditors from exercising certain rights or taking certain actions with respect to collateral, including repossession or liquidation of the leased vehicles. It is unclear how many lessees have been and will continue to beadversely affected by the outbreak and whether related efforts by the Federal, state and local governments will be effective in mitigating the spread of COVID-19 throughout the nation. To the extent thecurrent economic downturn results in increased delinquencies and defaults by lessees on the leases due to financial hardship or otherwise, the servicer may implement a range of actions with respect to affected lessees and the related leases toextend or modify the payment terms on the leases consistent with the servicer’s customary servicing practices. Across the nation, servicers of motor vehicle leases, including VW Credit, experienced an increase in the requests for deferrals bylessees related to COVID-19 and a significant number of such deferrals have been granted, including by VW Credit. Beginning in March 2020, VW Credit implemented theCOVID-19 Customer Assistance Program to assist customers impacted by COVID-19. Lessees requesting relief under the COVID-19Customer Assistance Program during the period beginning on March 12, 2020 and ending on June 28, 2020 were offered a three month retail payment deferral with no fees and no minimum number of payments required. Lessees requesting reliefunder the COVID-19 Customer Assistance Program during the period beginning on June 29, 2020 and ending on September 10, 2020, were offered a second payment deferral on a case by case basis. As ofSeptember 11, 2020, customer relief under the COVID-19 Customer Assistance Program was no longer available. Although the frequency of requests for deferrals has recently declined, a worsening of the COVID-19 outbreak and a resurgence of widespread stay-at-home orders may occur at any time, which could again lead to a sharp increasein requests from lessees for deferrals related to COVID-19 or general economic hardship and a reinstatement of the COVID-19 Customer Assistance Program or a similarprogram. There is no guarantee that a deferral granted by the servicer will prevent a future default by a lessee. Any lease for which the servicer’s records as of the cutoff date indicate that the related lessee received a deferral related to COVID-19 has been excluded from the pool of leases allocated to the Transaction SUBI.Further, many motor vehicle finance companies, including VW Credit, temporarily suspended involuntary repossession activity nationwide as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. In March 2020, VW Credit temporarily suspended all repossession activities in all 50 states in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Only essential recoveries(where allowed by law) continued to occur, which included impounded vehicles, customer surrenders and fraud vehicles. VW Credit has resumed involuntary repossession activity where permitted by local law, but may elect (or berequired) to again suspend such activity at any time in the future. The reduction in the repossession rate related to the COVID-19 outbreak and the general limited availability of used car auctions and othermarkets for the sale of repossessed vehicles have generally resulted in delays and/or decreases in recoveries for non-performing leases. Consequently, if a leased vehicle is repossessed while the used carauction market is not fully functioning, it is likely that the sale proceeds for such leased vehicle will be lower than expected, resulting in increased losses that may result in losses on your notes.Because a pandemic such as COVID-19 has notoccurred in recent years, historical loss experience is unlikely to accurately predict the performance of the leases allocated to the Transaction SUBI. See “—Credit scores and historical loss experience may not accurately predict thelikelihood of losses on the leases” below. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects the United States economy, including the ability of lessees to meet their payment obligations under the leases, financial markets or the business or operations of the sponsor orthe servicer, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section, such as those related to the ability of lessees to meet their payment obligations under the leases, usedvehicle values, the performance, market value, credit ratings and secondary market liquidity of your notes, and risks of geographic concentration of the lessees. All of the foregoing could have a negative impact on the performance of the leases and,as a result, you may experience delays in payments or losses on your notes.Recent economic developments may adversely affect the performance of the leases, which could result in losses on your notes. A deterioration in economic conditions could adversely affect the ability and willingness of lessees to meet their payment obligations underthe leases. Economic conditions could deteriorate in connection with an economic recession or due to events such as reduced business activity, high unemployment, volatile interest rates, rising or falling oil prices, housing price declines, lack ofavailable credit, the rate of inflation and consumer perceptions of the economy, as well as other factors, such as terrorist events, civil unrest, public health emergencies or extreme weather conditions or an increase of lessees’ paymentobligations under other indebtedness incurred by the lessees. The issuing entity’s ability to make payments on the notes could be adversely affected if lessees were unable to make timely payments or if the servicer elected to, or was requiredto, implement forbearance programs in connection with lessees suffering a hardship (including hardships related to the outbreak of COVID-19).The United States has entered into a recession of unknown length and severity, whichmay adversely affect the performance of the leases and the performance and market value of your notes. See “—Adverse events arising from the global Coronavirus outbreak could result in delays in payment or losses on your notes”above. Periods of economic slowdown or recession are often characterized by high unemployment and diminished availability of credit, generally resulting in increases in delinquencies, defaults and losses on automobile leases and repossessions of therelated leased vehicles, as well as decreased consumer demand for automobiles and reduced vehicle prices, which may increase the amount of a loss in the event of a default by a lessee. See “—The residual value of leased vehicles may beadversely  affected by discount pricing incentives, marketing incentive programs and economic developments” below. Motor vehicle financecompanies, including VW Credit, and banks experienced a sharp increase in delinquencies and/or requests for deferrals related to COVID-19 and a significant number of such deferrals have been granted, includingby VW Credit. Although the frequency of requests for deferrals has recently declined, a worsening of the COVID-19 outbreak and a resurgence of widespread stay-at-home orders may occur at any time, which could again lead to a sharp increase in requests from lessees for deferrals related to COVID-19 or general economichardship. Further, periods of economic slowdown may also be accompanied bydecreased consumer demand for automobiles, increased turn-in rates and declining market values of off-lease vehicles, which could increase the amount of a loss in theevent of a default by a lessee. Significant increases in the inventory of used automobiles during periods of economic slowdown or recession may also depress the prices at which repossessed and off-leaseautomobiles may be sold or delay the timing of these sales. Vehicle sales and other activity in the consumer automotive market sharply declined following the COVID-19 outbreak and may decline again in thefuture, especially if directives requiring stay-at-home orders and the closure of “nonessential” businesses in an effort to slow the COVID-19 outbreak continue for a prolonged period of time or are re-implemented.If an economic downturn is experienced for a prolonged period of time, it is expected that delinquencies, defaults and repossessions will increase and thatlosses on the leases could increase, which could result in losses on your notes. It is possible that a higher percentage of lessees will seek protection under bankruptcy or debtor relief laws as a result of financial and economic disruptions relatedto the COVID-19 pandemic than is reflected in VW Credit’s historical experience. See “—Adverse events arising from the global Coronavirus outbreak could result in delays in payment or losseson your notes” above. Additionally, an improvement in economic conditions could result in prepayments by the lessees of their payment obligations under the leases. As a result, you may receive principal payments of your notes earlier thananticipated. Further, the market values of the related leased vehicles could increase or decrease based on economic conditions.No prediction or assurance can be made as to the effect of an economic downturn or economic growth on the rate of delinquencies, prepayments and/or losses onthe leases, and all of these factors could result in losses on your notes.The geographic concentration of the lessees in the pool of leases and related leased vehicles and varying economic circumstances may increase the risk of losses or reduce the return on your notes.The concentration of the leases in specific geographic areas may increase the risk of loss. A deterioration in economic conditions in the states where lessees reside, including those caused by theCOVID-19 pandemic, and the related governmental responses to such economic conditions (such as repossession or creditors’ rights moratoriums), could adversely affect the ability and willingness of lesseesto meet their payment obligations under the leases and the ability to sell or dispose of the related vehicles for an amount at least equal to their Automotive Lease Guide residual values, and may consequently affect the delinquency, loss andrepossession experience of the issuing entity with respect to the leases and related leased vehicles in such states. As a result, you may experience payment delays or losses on your notes. An improvement in economic conditions could result inprepayments by the lessees of their payment obligations under the leases. As a result, you may receive principal payments of your notes earlier than anticipated. No prediction can be made and no assurance can begiven as to the effect of the current economic downturn or any future economic growth or further economic decline on the rate of delinquencies, prepayments and/or losses on the leases. See “—Returns on your investments may be reduced byprepayments on the leases, events of default, optional redemption of the notes or reallocations of the leases and leased vehicles from the Transaction SUBI” below. As of the cutoff date, based on the state of origination of the leases(based on the address of the lessee), 18.90%, 13.51%, 13.29%, 8.64% and 6.44% of the aggregate securitization value of the related leases and leased vehicles were located in California, New York, Florida, New Jersey and Texas, respectively. No otherstate accounts for more than 5.00% of the aggregate securitization value of the pool of leases and leased vehicles as of the cutoff date. Due to the recent economic downturn with respect to the oil and gas industry resulting from the decline in oilprices, leases located in the state of Texas may experience higher delinquencies or defaults than in prior securitizations. Management believes that there are no other factors unique to any state or region in which 10% or more of the aggregatesecuritization value of the leases and leased vehicles are located that may materially impact the issuing entity’s ability to pay principal and interest on the notes. Economic factors such as unemployment, interest rates, the price of gasoline,the rate of inflation and consumer perceptions of the economy may affect the rate of prepayments and defaults on the leases. Further, the effect of natural disasters, such as pandemics, hurricanes, wildfires and floods, on the performance of theleases, is unclear, but there may be a significant adverse effect on general economic conditions, consumer confidence and general market liquidity.Because of the concentration of the leases in certain states, any adverse economic conditions, natural disasters or other factors affecting these states inparticular, including disruptions caused by COVID-19, may have a greater effect on the performance of the notes than if the concentration did not exist.The return on your notes could be reduced by shortfalls due to extreme weather conditions, natural disasters and public health concerns.Extreme weather conditions and public health concerns (including the COVID-19 pandemic) could cause substantial business disruptions, economic losses, unemployment and/or an economic downturn.As a result, the related lessees’ ability to meet their payment obligations under the leases could be adversely affected. The issuing entity’s ability to make payments on the notes could be adversely affected if the related lessees wereunable to make timely payments.Risks Relating to the Leases, the Lessees and the Related Leased VehiclesThe concentration of leased vehicles to particular models could negatively affect the issuing entity’s assets.The Tiguan, Q5 and Jetta models represent approximately 19.14%, 17.81% and 10.15% of the aggregate securitization value, respectively, of the related leases allocated to the Transaction SUBI as of the cutoff date. No other modelaccounts for more than 10.00% of the aggregate securitization value of the pool of leases and leased vehicles as of the cutoff date. Any adverse change in the value of a specific model type would reduce the proceeds received at disposition of arelated leased vehicle. As a result, you may incur a loss on your investment.Credit scores and historical loss experience may not accurately predict the likelihood of losses on the leases.Information regarding credit scores for the lessees obtained at the time of origination of the related lease is presented in “The Leases—Representations, Warranties and Covenants—Eligibility Criteria and Portfolio Characteristics” in this prospectus. A credit score purports only to be a measurement of the relative degree of risk aborrower represents to a lender, i.e., that a borrower with a higher score is statistically expected to be less likely to default in payment than a borrower with a lower score. Further, credit score models were built prior to the global outbreak of COVID-19, and consequently, were not designed to take into account the social, economic and financial disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Neither the depositor, thesponsor nor any other party makes any representations or warranties as to any lessee’s current credit score or the actual performance of any lease or that a particular credit score should be relied upon as a basis for an expectation that alease will be paid in accordance with its terms. Additionally, historical loss anddelinquency information set forth in this prospectus under “Prepayments, Delinquencies, Repossessions and Net Losses—Delinquency, Repossession and Loss Data” was affected by several variables, including general economicconditions and market residual values, that are expected to differ in the immediate future, and are likely to differ in the longer term future, in particular due to the current economic downturn in the United States arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. Delinquencies and losses with respect to leases generally have trended higher during periods of economic uncertainty, and these negative trends may continue. Therefore, there can be no assurancethat the future delinquency or net loss experience calculated and presented in this prospectus with respect to VW Credit’s managed portfolio of leases will reflect actual experience with respect to the leases allocated to the TransactionSUBI. The servicer experienced a sharp increase in requests for deferralsnationwide following the start of the COVID-19 outbreak and a significant number of such deferrals have been granted. Further, the servicer temporarily suspended involuntary repossession activities nationwideas a result of the COVID-19 outbreak and temporarily modified its customary servicing practices to address other collections activity for COVID-19 affected customers andin jurisdictions in which the market for the sale of used cars was disrupted as a result of stay-at-home orders and similar directives. The servicer has resumedinvoluntary repossessions and other collections activities where permitted by local law, but may elect (or be required) to again suspend such activity, or otherwise modify its customary servicing practices, at any time in the future.The COVID-19 outbreak is impacting lesseesnationwide and is expected to have a materially more significant impact on VW Credit’s managed portfolio of leases (including the performance of the leases allocated to the Transaction SUBI) than even the most severe historical naturaldisasters during the years reflected in the historical loss and delinquency information set forth in this prospectus. As a result, investors should expect increased delinquencies on the leases and potentially higher losses on the leases, and suchincreases could be substantial. Consequently, payments on the notes could be adversely affected.The residual value of leased vehicles may be adversely affected by discount pricing incentives, marketing incentive programs and economic developments.Historical residual value loss experience on leased vehicles is partially attributable to new vehicles pricing policies of all manufacturers. Discount pricing incentives or other marketing incentive programs on new vehicles by VWCredit or by its competitors that effectively reduce the prices of new vehicles may have the effect of reducing demand by consumers for used vehicles. Although VW Credit currently does not have any marketing incentive program that reduces the prices of new vehicles, it mayintroduce such programs in the future. The residual value published inAutomotive Lease Guide for a leased vehicle and the stated residual value for a leased vehicle are only estimates, and are not guarantees of the residual value of a leased vehicle. The reduced demand for used vehicles resulting from discountpricing incentives or other marketing incentive programs introduced by VW Credit or any of its competitors may reduce the prices consumers will be willing to pay for used vehicles, including leased vehicles included in the pool assets at the end ofthe related leases and thus reduce the residual value of such leased vehicles.Significant increases in the inventory of used vehicles during periods of economic slowdown or recession may also depress the prices at which off-lease vehicles may be sold or delay the timing of these sales. Furthermore, specific models and vehicle types may experience a greater than anticipated decline in the residual value and used vehicle prices undercertain market conditions. As a result of these factors, the proceeds received bythe origination trust upon disposition of leased vehicles may be reduced and may not be sufficient to pay amounts owing on the notes.Used vehicle market factors may increase the risk of loss on your investment.The prices for used vehicles declined significantly at the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, but have since recovered. Used vehicle prices could significantly decline again if the COVID-19 outbreak worsens. The used vehicle market is affected by supply and demand for those vehicles, which, in turn, is affected by consumer tastes, economic factors and conditions, fuel costs, legislationrelating to emissions and fuel efficiency, manufacturer decisions on introduction and pricing of new vehicle models, the volume of vehicles whose lease terms are expiring and other factors, including the impact of vehicle recalls or thediscontinuation of vehicle models or brands. For instance, introduction of a new model by Volkswagen AG or its affiliates may impact the resale value of the existing portfolio of similar model types. Discount pricing incentives or othermarketing incentive programs on new vehicles by Volkswagen AG or by its competitors that effectively reduce the prices of new vehicles may have the effect of reducing demand by consumers for used vehicles. Other factors that are beyond thecontrol of the issuing entity, the depositor and the servicer could also have a negative impact on the resale value of a vehicle. For example, the imposition of increased tariffs on imported vehicles may also affect the pricing and availability ofboth new and used vehicles. If programs are implemented by the United States government to stimulate the sale of new vehicles, this may have the effect of further reducing the values of used vehicles, resulting in increased losses that may result inlosses on your notes. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has influenced the supply of new and used vehicles. Initially stay at home orders restricted activity in the used vehicle market. This reduced supplyof new and, as a consequence used vehicles, led to an increase in the value of used vehicles. Further COVID restrictions could impair the servicer’s ability to liquidate leased vehicles, which may adversely impact the resale value for returnedor repossessed leased vehicles and/or cause substantial delays in leased vehicle liquidations. Increased vehicle inventories may result from new vehicle supply returning, lease extensions returning and increased repossessions, which could adverselyaffect resale values. Economic factors will influencethe affordability of used vehicles. Customer behavior may evolve with working from home arrangements, including the risk that working from home reduces the demand for vehicle purchases. All of these factors could have a negativeimpact on the resale value of a vehicle. If the proceeds actually realized upon the sale of the leased vehicles are substantially lower than the residual values originally established by VW Credit, you may suffer a loss on your investment.Increased turn-in rates may increase losses.Under each lease, the lessee may elect to purchase the related vehicle at the expiration of the lease for an amount generally equal to the stated residual value established at the inception of the lease. Lessees who decide not topurchase their related vehicles at lease expiration will expose the issuing entity to possible losses if the sale prices of those vehicles in the used vehicle market are less than their respective stated residual values. The level of turn-ins at termination of the leases could be adversely affected by the convenience of the turn-in process generally (including as a result of temporary modifications to thelease turn-in process implemented in response to COVID-19), lessee views on vehicle quality, the relative attractiveness of new models available to the lessees, salesand lease incentives offered with respect to other vehicles (including those offered by VW Credit), the level of the purchase option prices for the related vehicles compared to new and used vehicle prices and economic conditions generally. The grantof deferrals, extensions and the early termination of leases by lessees may affect the number of turn-ins in a particular month. If losses resulting from increasedturn-ins exceed the credit enhancement for the notes, you may suffer a loss on your investment.You may experience a loss if defaults on the leases or residual losses exceed the available credit enhancement. The issuing entity does not have, nor is it permitted or expected to have, any significant assets or sources of funds other than the relatedTransaction SUBI Certificate, together with available funds in the collection account and the reserve account. The notes represent obligations solely of the issuing entity and will not be insured or guaranteed by any entity. Accordingly, you willrely primarily upon collections on the leases and the related leased vehicles allocated to the Transaction SUBI owned by the issuing entity and amounts on deposit in the collection account and the reserve account. Funds on deposit in the reserveaccount will cover shortfalls due to delinquencies on the leases and losses on the leases and leased vehicles up to the amount on deposit therein. However, if delinquencies and losses create shortfalls which exceed the available credit enhancement,you may experience delays in payments due to you and you could suffer a loss. You will have no claim to any amounts properly distributed to the depositor or others from time to time.In establishing the stated residual value of leased vehicles, VW Credit uses aninternally developed proprietary model. There is no guarantee that the assumptions regarding future events that are used to determine residual values will prove to be correct. If the stated residual values of the leased vehicles as originallydetermined by VW Credit are substantially higher than the sales proceeds actually realized upon the sale of the leased vehicles, you may suffer losses if the available credit enhancement for your notes is exceeded.For a discussion of factors that may contribute to residual value losses, you shouldrefer to “—Used vehicle market factors may increase the risk of loss on your investment,” “—Increased turn-in rates may increase losses”, “—Theconcentration of leased vehicles to particular models could negatively affect the issuing entity’s assets”, “—The geographic concentration of the lessees in the pool of leases and related leased vehicles and varying economic circumstances may increase the risk of losses orreduce the return on your notes” and “The Sponsor—Determination of Residual Values” in this prospectus.Inadequate insurance on leased vehicles may cause losses on your investment. Each lease requires the lessee to maintain insurance covering physical damage to the leased vehicle with the origination trust named as aloss payee. The lessees select their own insurers to provide the required coverage, so the specific terms and conditions of their insurance policies vary.Although the sponsor typically assures that the lessee’s insurance requirement is satisfied at the inception of a lease, neither the sponsor nor theservicer is obligated to monitor whether a lessee continues to satisfy its insurance requirement during the term of the lease. In the event insurance coverage is not maintained by lessees, then insurance recoveries may not be available in the eventof losses or damages to leased vehicles included in the pool, and you could suffer a loss on your investment.Vehicle recalls may have an adverse effect on the leases and your notes. From time to time, automobile manufacturers or their suppliers may discover an element in a vehicle which might possibly affect the safety orother features of the vehicle, including compliance with applicable safety or emissions standards. In such cases the manufacturer in consultation with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration may recall the affected vehicles for repair orother necessary service. In certain cases, a recall may give rise to the lessee having the right to rescind or terminate its contract or an obligation of the related vehicle manufacturer to repurchase the related recalled vehicle. In addition,recalls or other service campaigns could cause a temporary suspension of sales of the affected vehicles until completion of any necessary repairs, which may cause a delay of the timing of the sales of returned or repossessed vehicles in the usedvehicle markets. Recalls or other service campaigns, including as a result of the failure of a particular model to comply with applicable safety or emissions standards, may also cause a decrease in demand for the affected vehicles in the usedvehicle market, which may cause a decline in values of those vehicles. Declines in values of used vehicles could cause an increase in credit losses. If any of these events materially affect collections on the leases securing your notes, you mayexperience delays in payments or principal losses on your notes if the available credit enhancement has been exhausted.Volkswagen Group of America is recalling certain Audi Q7 crossovers from the 2018-20 model years built between July2017 and April 2020 in the U.S. because the deformation element on the C-pillar may not have been properly manufactured and this will cause a noncompliance issue with NHTSA’s FMVSS 201. Dealers andcustomers will be notified on or before November 30, 2020 and the deformation element on the driver and passenger side C-pillar will be replaced free of charge. The recall campaign began onNovember 13, 2020. Sales of the affected vehicles are not permitted until completion of any necessary repairs. As of the cutoff date, 1,947 leases, representing approximately 7.66% of the aggregate securitization value of the leases allocatedto the Transaction SUBI as of the cutoff date, are subject to the recall. Risks Relating to the Sponsor and ServicerAdverse legal or regulatory developments with respect to VW Credit or its affiliates could have an adverse effect on your notes. The sponsor and its affiliates (including Volkswagen AG, the sponsor’s ultimate parent) are party to, or are periodically otherwiseinvolved in, reviews, investigations, examinations and proceedings (both formal and informal), and information-gathering requests, by government and self-regulatory agencies, including the CFPB, the DOJ, the SEC, and various state authorities.Examinations can include various focal points, such as fair lending, servicing of accounts, and evaluations of compliance management systems. The findings of these examinations may result in the repurchase of leases. See “TheSponsor—Recent Developments—Legal and Regulatory.” Volkswagen AGis party to other legal actions and investigations in and outside the United States, and further regulatory proceedings, environmental, consumer, product-related and investor claims could be raised against Volkswagen AG in the future in variousjurisdictions worldwide. These proceedings and actions and publicity surrounding them could have an adverse effect on your notes, even in circumstances where neither we nor the sponsor is a party to or otherwise involved in the proceedings or otheractions. For example, regulatory and legal actions against Volkswagen AG, Volkswagen Group of America, Inc. (“Volkswagen Group of America”), the sponsor or other affiliates of the sponsor related to the manufacture andsale of affected vehicles may result in reputational damage to Volkswagen AG and Volkswagen Group of America, as well as to the “Volkswagen” and “Audi” brands. The pricing of used vehicles is affected by the supply anddemand for those vehicles. If the demand for used Volkswagen or Audi vehicles decreases as a result of the issues arising after the Notices of Violation (as defined under “The Sponsor—Recent Developments—Legal andRegulatory”), related regulatory or legal actions or other factors, the resale value of the leased vehicles may also decrease. Further, these and any other reviews, investigations, examinations and proceedings (whether formal or informal)and/or information-gathering requests that the sponsor or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates are involved in, or may become involved in, may result in adverse consequences to the sponsor including, without limitation, adverse judgments,settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, or other actions and may affect the ability of the sponsor or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates to perform its duties under the transaction documents.Adverse events with respect to VW Credit or its affiliates or third party providers to whom VW Credit outsources its activities could affect the timing of payments on your notes or have other adverse effects on yournotes.Adverse events with respect to VW Credit or any of its affiliates or a third party provider to whom VW Credit outsources its activities could result in servicing disruptions or reduce the market value of your notes. For example,servicing disruptions could result from unanticipated events beyond VW Credit’s control, such as natural disasters, civil unrest, public health emergencies (including COVID-19 or similar outbreaks) andeconomic disruptions, particularly to the extent such events affected VW Credit’s business or operations. For example, if significant portions of VW Credit’s workforce are unable to work effectively as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including because of illness, stay-at-home orders, facility closures or ineffective remote work arrangements, theremay be servicing disruptions, which could result in reduced collection effectiveness. Further, certain third-parties that VW Credit relies on to deliver products and services to support their business have recently indicated that they may be unableto fully perform in a timely manner and similar notifications may be received in the near future, which could adversely impact VW Credit’s ability to operate its business or perform its obligations underthe transaction documents or could cause a disruption in collection activities with respect to the leases and related leased vehicles allocatedto the Transaction SUBI. See “—Adverse events arising from the global Coronavirus outbreak could result in delays in payment or losses on your notes.” In addition, in the event of a termination and replacement of VW Credit asthe servicer, there may be some disruption of the collection activity with respect to delinquent leases and therefore delinquencies and credit losses could increase. Similarly, if VW Credit becomes unable to repurchase the beneficial interest in anyleases and related leased vehicles which do not comply with representations and warranties about the leases made by VW Credit in the SUBI sale agreement, then investors could suffer losses. In addition, adverse corporate developments with respect toservicers of asset-backed securities or their affiliates have in some cases also resulted in a reduction in the market value of the related asset-backed securities. For example, VW Credit is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Volkswagen AG.Although Volkswagen AG is not guaranteeing the obligations of the issuing entity, if Volkswagen AG ceased to manufacture vehicles or support the sale of vehicles or if Volkswagen AG faced financial or operational difficulties or issued recallnotices with respect to vehicles it manufactured, such events may reduce the market value of the notes and/or reduce the market value of Volkswagen and Audi vehicles, and ultimately the amount realized on any Volkswagen or Audi leased vehicle,including the leased vehicles allocated to the Transaction SUBI. Further, VW Creditrelies upon its ability to sell securities in the asset backed securities market and upon its ability to access various credit facilities to fund its operations. As discussed under “—Adverse events arising from the global Coronavirusoutbreak could result in delays in payment or losses on your notes,” the global credit and financial markets have recently experienced, and may continue to experience, significant disruption and volatility. Recent government and regulatoryactions may not be successful in mitigating the adverse economic effects of COVID-19. Sustained adverse economic effects from the pandemic may also result in downgrades in the credit ratings of VW Credit oradversely affect the interest rate environment. VW Credit cannot predict how the COVID-19 outbreak and the legal and regulatory responses to the COVID-19 outbreak andrelated economic disruptions will continue to affect its businesses, including its liquidity or the ability to access the capital markets. If VW Credit’s access to funding is reduced or if its costs to obtain such funding significantlyincreases, its business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected which could adversely affect its ability to perform its obligations under the transaction documents.The servicer’s commingling of funds with its own funds could result in a loss.Subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth under “Description of the Transaction Documents—The Accounts—The Collection Account”, VW Credit, as the servicer, may be able to commingle fundsrelating to this transaction such as security deposits, collections from the leases and proceeds from the disposition of the related leased vehicles with its own funds during each collection period and may be able to make a single deposit to thecollection account on each payment date. See “Description of the Transaction Documents—The Accounts—The Collection Account” in this prospectus. Commingled funds may be used or invested by the servicer at its own risk andfor its own benefit. If the servicer were unable to remit such funds or the servicer were to become a debtor under any insolvency laws, delays or reductions in distributions to you may occur. In addition,ifthe servicer failed to remit to the lessees the required portions of their security deposits at the expiration of their leases, the origination trust could be held liable for those portions of the security deposits, and investors inthe notes could incur a loss on their investment as a result.The servicer’s discretion over the servicing of the leases may impact the amount and timing of funds available to make payments on the notes. The servicer is obligated to service the leases and related leased vehicles in accordance with its customary practices. The servicer hasdiscretion in servicing the leases and the related leased vehicles, including the ability to grant payment extensions and to determine the timing and method of collection and liquidation procedures. The servicer, in its own discretion, may permit anextension on, or a deferral of, lease payments due or halt repossession activity on a case-by-case basis or more broadly in accordance with its customaryservicing practices, for example, in connection with a natural disaster or public health emergency affecting a large group of lessees. The servicer experienced a sharp increase in requests for deferrals relatedto COVID-19 nationwide and a significant number of such deferrals have been granted. However, there is no guarantee that a deferral granted by the servicer will prevent a future default by a lessee.Further, as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, the servicer temporarily suspended involuntary repossession activities nationwide and temporarily modified its customary servicing practices to addressother collections activity for COVID-19 affected customers and in jurisdictions in which the market for the sale of used cars was disrupted as a result of stay-at-home orders and similar directives. The servicer has resumed involuntary repossessions and other collections activity where permitted by local law, but may elect (or be required) to againsuspend such activity at any time in the future. See “—Adverse events arising from the global Coronavirus outbreak could result in delays in payment or losses on your notes.”Payment extensions, other modifications to the leases or delays in initiatingrepossession activity may extend the maturity of the leases, increase the weighted average life of any class of notes and reduce the yield on your notes. Further, absent a breach of an eligibility representation or warranty (but only if such breachis not cured and materially and adversely affects the interests of the issuing entity or the noteholders) or a breach of a servicing covenant specifically requiring reallocation, VW Credit will have no obligation to repurchase the beneficialinterest in any lease or related leased vehicle for which the related lessee was adversely affected by the outbreak of COVID-19 (including in the event the related lease is extended or modified after thecutoff date). See “Description of the Transaction Documents—Representations and Warranties” and “The Servicer— Extensions, Deferrals and Pull-Aheads” in this prospectus.In addition, the servicer’s customary practices may change from time to time andthose changes could reduce collections on the leases and related leased vehicles. Although the servicer’s customary practices at any time will apply to all vehicles and leases held by the origination trust, without regard to whether a vehicleand related lease has been allocated to a securitization transaction, the servicer is not obligated to maximize collections from the leases and related leased vehicles. Consequently, the manner in which the servicer exercises its servicingdiscretion or changes its customary practices could have an impact on the amount and timing of collections on the leases and the related leased vehicles, which may impact the amount and timing of funds available to make payments on thenotes. Risks Relating to Material Legal AspectsThe origination trust may not have a perfected interest in leases evidenced by electronic contracts. The servicer, on behalf of the origination trust, has contracted with a third-party to originate and maintain custody of certain of thecontracts in electronic form through the third-party custodian’s technology system. The third-party custodian’s technology system is designed to enable the origination trust to perfect its interest in the leases evidenced by electronicrecords by satisfying the Uniform Commercial Code’s requirements for “control” of electronic chattel paper. In order for the origination trust to have “control” of an item of electronic chattel paper, (a) there must bea “single authoritative copy” of the electronic record or records comprising such electronic chattel paper that is readily distinguishable from all other copies and which identifies the origination trust as the assignee of the chattelpaper, (b) all other copies of the electronic chattel paper must indicate that they are not the “authoritative copy” of the electronic chattel paper, (c) any revisions to the authoritative copy of the electronic chattel papermust be readily identifiable as either authorized or unauthorized revisions and (d) authorized revisions of the electronic chattel paper cannot be made without the participation of the origination trust.However, another person could acquire an interest in an electronic contract that issuperior to the interest of the origination trust (and accordingly the issuing entity’s interest), if (a) the origination trust ceases to have “control” over the items of electronic chattel paper that are maintained on behalf ofthe origination trust by the third-party custodian and (b) another party acquires ownership or a collateral security interest in the electronic chattel paper and perfects its security interest either by filing a financing statement or taking“control” over the electronic chattel paper. The origination trust could also lose “control” over an electronic contract if through fraud, forgery, negligence or error, or as a result of a computer virus or a failure of orweakness in the third-party custodian’s technology system a person other than the origination trust were able to modify or duplicate the authoritative copy of the contract.Although the origination trust’s interest in the electronic contracts has beenperfected by filing financing statements, the fact that the origination trust’s interest in the electronic contracts may not be perfected by “control” may affect the priority of the origination trust’s interest in such leases.For example, the issuing entity’s interest in the leases could be junior to another party with a prior perfected security interest in the inventory of the originating dealer, which security interest would attach to the leases as proceeds of theinventory. There can be no assurances that the third-party’s technology systemwill perform as represented to the servicer in maintaining the systems and controls required to provide assurance that the origination trust maintains “control” over an electronic contract. In that event, there may be delays in obtainingcopies of the electronic contract or confirming ownership and “control” of the electronic contract.Interests of other persons in the leases and the leased vehicles could be superior to the issuing entity’s interest, which may result in delayed or reduced payment on your notes.Because the Transaction SUBI will represent a beneficial interest in the Transaction SUBI assets, you will be dependent on payments made on the leases allocated to the Transaction SUBI and proceeds received in connection with thesale or other disposition of the related leased vehicles for payments on your notes. The issuing entity will not have a direct ownership interest in the leases or a direct ownership interest orperfected security interest in the related leased vehicles, which will be titled in the name of the origination trust or the origination trustee onbehalf of the origination trust. It is therefore possible that a claim against or lien on the leased vehicles or the other assets of the origination trust could limit the amounts payable in respect of the Transaction SUBI Certificate to less thanthe amounts received from the lessees of the leased vehicles or received from the sale or other disposition of the leased vehicles.Further, liens in favor of and/or enforceable by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation could attach to the leases and leased vehicles owned by theorigination trust (including the leases and the leased vehicles allocated to the Transaction SUBI) and could be used to satisfy unfunded ERISA obligations of any member of a controlled group that includes VW Credit and its affiliates. Because theseliens could attach directly to the leases and leased vehicles allocated to the Transaction SUBI and because the issuing entity does not have a prior perfected security interest in the assets of the Transaction SUBI, these liens could have priorityover the interest of the issuing entity in the assets of the Transaction SUBI. See “—If ERISA liens are placed on the origination trust assets, you could suffer a loss” in this prospectus.To the extent a third party makes a claim against, or files a lien on, the assets ofthe origination trust, including the leased vehicles allocated to the Transaction SUBI, it may delay the disposition of those leased vehicles or reduce the amount paid to the issuing entity, as holder of the Transaction SUBI Certificate. If thatoccurs, you may experience delays in payment or losses on your investment. For moreinformation on the effect of third-party claims or liens on payment of the notes, you should refer to “Additional Legal Aspects of the Origination Trust and the Transaction SUBI—Allocation of Origination Trust Liabilities” inthis prospectus.If ERISA liens are placed on the origination trust assets, you could suffer a loss. Liens in favor of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation could attach to the leases and leased vehicles owned by the origination trust(including the leases and the leased vehicles allocated to the Transaction SUBI) and could be used to satisfy unfunded pension obligations of any member of a controlled group that includes VW Credit and its affiliates which has unfunded pensionliabilities under its defined benefit pension plans. Because these liens could attach directly to the leases and leased vehicles and because the issuing entity does not have a prior perfected security interest in the assets included in a TransactionSUBI, these liens could have priority over the interest of the issuing entity in the assets included in the Transaction SUBI.From time to time, the rating agencies rating your notes may request information with respect to any defined benefit pension plans maintained or sponsored byVW Credit or any of its affiliates. Although VW Credit will use reasonable efforts to comply with such request, there is no assurance that VW Credit will be able to provide the requested information. Any rating downgrade could result in a decline inthe market value of your notes.A depositor or sponsor bankruptcy could delay or limit payments to you.Following a bankruptcy or insolvency of the sponsor or the depositor, a court could conclude that the Transaction SUBI Certificate is owned by the sponsor or the depositor, instead of the issuing entity. This conclusion could beeither because the transfer of that Transaction SUBI Certificate from VW Credit to the depositor or from the depositor to the issuing entity was not a true sale or because the court concluded that thedepositor or the issuing entity should be treated as the same entity as VW Credit or the depositor for bankruptcy purposes. VW Credit will not treat the sale of the Transaction SUBI to the depositor as a sale for generally accepted accountingprinciple purposes, and this fact could make a court more likely to reach that conclusion than if such sale were treated as a sale by VW Credit for generally accepted accounting principle purposes. If this were to occur, you could experience delaysin payments due to you or you may not ultimately receive all amounts due to you as a result of:•   the automatic stay, which prevents a secured creditor from exercising remedies against adebtor in bankruptcy without permission from the court, and provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code that permit substitution of collateral in limited circumstances;•   tax or government liens on the sponsor’s or depositor’s property (that aroseprior to the transfer of the Transaction SUBI Certificate to the issuing entity) having a prior claim on collections before the collections are used to make payments on the notes; or•   the fact that neitherthe issuing entity nor the indenture trustee has a perfected security interest in the leases and leased vehicles allocated to the Transaction SUBI and may not have a perfected security interest in any cash collections of the leases and leasedvehicles allocated to the Transaction SUBI held by the servicer at the time that a bankruptcy proceeding begins.For a discussion of how a bankruptcy proceeding of the sponsor or the depositor may affect the issuing entity and the notes, you should refer to“Additional Legal Aspects of the Origination Trust and the Transaction SUBI—Insolvency Related Matters” in this prospectus.Vicarious tort liability may result in a loss. Some states allow a party that incurs an injury involving a vehicle to sue the owner of the vehicle merely because of that ownership. Asowner of the vehicles, the origination trust may be subject to these lawsuits. Most, but not all, states, however, either prohibit these vicarious liability suits against leasing companies or limit the lessor’s liability to the amount ofliability insurance that the lessee was required to carry under applicable law but failed to maintain.On August 10, 2005, President George W. Bush signed into law the Safe Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient Transportation Equity Act of 2005 (the“Transportation Act”), Pub. L. No. 109-59. The Transportation Act provides that an owner of a motor vehicle that rents or leases the vehicle to a person will not be liable under the lawof a state or political subdivision by reason of being the owner of the vehicle, for harm to persons or property that results or arises out of the use, operation, or possession of the vehicle during the period of the rental or lease, if (i) theowner (or an affiliate of the owner) is engaged in the trade or business of renting or leasing motor vehicles; and (ii) there is no negligence or criminal wrongdoing on the part of the owner (or an affiliate of the owner). This provision of theTransportation Act was effective upon enactment and applies to any action commenced on or after August 10, 2005. The Transportation Act is intended to preempt state and local laws that impose possible vicarious tort liability on entities owningmotor vehicles that are rented or leased and it is expected that the Transportation Act should reduce the likelihood of vicarious liability being imposed on the origination trust. State andfederal courts considering whether the Transportation Act preempts state laws permitting vicarious liability have generally concluded that such laws are preempted with respect to cases commenced on or after August 10, 2005. While the vastmajority of courts have concluded that the Transportation Act preempts state laws permitting vicarious liability, one New York lower court has reached a contrary conclusion in a case involving a leasing trust. This New York court concluded that thepreemption provision in the Transportation Act was an unconstitutional exercise of congressional authority under the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution and, therefore, did not preempt New York law regarding vicarious liability. NewYork’s appellate court overruled the trial court and upheld the constitutionality of the preemption provision in the Transportation Act. New York’s highest court, the Court of Appeals, dismissed the appeal. In a 2008 decision relating to acase in Florida, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit upheld the constitutionality of the Transportation Act, and the plaintiffs’ petition seeking review of the decision by the U.S. Supreme Court was denied. In 2010, a similardecision was issued by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit. While the outcome in these cases upheld federal preemption under the Transportation Act, the outcome of cases that are pending in other jurisdictions and their impact areuncertain at this time. The servicer will be required to maintain liabilityinsurance coverage on behalf of the origination trust. However, this coverage is subject to deductibles and claims could be imposed against the assets of the origination trust which could exceed that coverage. In the event the servicer fails tomaintain this liability insurance coverage, the deductible is not satisfied or the insurance coverage protecting the origination trust is insufficient to cover, or does not cover, a material claim, that claim could be satisfied out of the proceedsof the leased vehicles and leases allocated to the Transaction SUBI and you could incur a loss on your investment.For a discussion of the possible liability of the origination trust in connection with the use or operation of the leased vehicles, you should refer to“Material Legal Aspects of the Leases and the Leased Vehicles—Vicarious Tort Liability” in this prospectus. Regulatory Risk FactorsFederal and state financial regulatory reform could have a significant impact on the servicer, the sponsor, the depositor or the issuing entity and could adversely affect the timing and amount of payments on your notes. On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) was enacted.Although the Dodd-Frank Act itself took effect on July 22, 2010, many of its provisions had delayed implementation dates or required implementing regulations to be issued. A number of these implementing regulations still have not been issued.The Dodd-Frank Act is extensive and significant legislation that, among other things:•   created a framework for the liquidation of certain bank holding companies and other nonbankfinancial companies, determined to be “covered financial companies”, in the event such a company is in default or in danger of default and the resolution of such a company under other applicable law would have serious adverse effects onfinancial stability in the United States, and also for the liquidation of certain of their respective subsidiaries, defined as “covered subsidiaries”, in the event such a subsidiary also determined to be a “covered financial company” because it is, among other things, in default or in dangerof default and the liquidation of such subsidiary would avoid or mitigate serious adverse effects on the financial stability or economic conditions of the United States;•   created a new framework for the regulation of over-the-counter derivatives activities;•   expanded the regulatory oversight of securities and capital markets activities by the SEC;and •   created theConsumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”), an agency responsible for, among other things, administering and enforcing the laws and regulations for consumer financial products and services and conducting examinations of largebanks and their affiliates for purposes of assessing compliance with the requirements of consumer financial laws.The CFPB has supervisory, examination and enforcement authority over certain non-depository institutions, includingthose entities that are larger participants of a market for consumer financial products or services as defined by the rule. As of August 31, 2015 VW Credit is subject to the CFPB’s supervision with respect to VW Credit’s compliancewith applicable consumer protection laws. In May 2019, the CFPB issued a proposedrule governing the activities of third-party debt collectors. While the proposed rule did not address first-party debt collectors, the CFPB has previously indicated that it would address this activity in a later rulemaking. It is unclearwhat changes will be included in any final debt collection rules issued by the CFPB and what effect, if any, such changes would have on the leases or the servicer’s practices, procedures and other servicing activities relating to theleases in ways that could reduce the associated recoveries. The Dodd-Frank Act alsoincreased the regulation of the securitization markets. For example, it gives broader powers to the SEC to regulate credit rating agencies and adopt regulations governing these organizations and their activities.Compliance with the implementing regulations under the Dodd-Frank Act or the oversightof the SEC, CFPB or other government entities, as applicable, may impose costs on, create operational constraints for, or place limits on pricing with respect to finance companies such as VW Credit. Because of the complexity of the Dodd-Frank Act,the ultimate impact and its effects on the financial markets and their participants will not be fully known for an extended period of time. In particular, no assurance can be given that these new requirements imposed, or to be imposed afterimplementing regulations are issued, by the Dodd-Frank Act will not have a significant impact on the servicing of the leases, and on the regulation and supervision of the servicer, the sponsor, the administrator, the depositor, the issuing entityand/or their respective affiliates. In addition, no assurances can be given thatthe framework for the liquidation of “covered financial companies” or their “covered subsidiaries” would not apply to VW Credit or its affiliates, including the issuingentity and the depositor, or, if it were to apply, would not result in a repudiation of any of the transaction documents where further performanceis required or an automatic stay or similar power preventing the indenture trustee or other transaction parties from exercising their rights. This repudiation power could also affect the transfer of the Transaction SUBI Certificate as furtherdescribed under “Additional Legal Aspects of the Origination Trust and the Transaction SUBI—Dodd-Frank Orderly Liquidation Framework—FDIC’s Repudiation Power under OLA” in this prospectus. Application of thisframework could materially adversely affect the timing and amount of payments of principal and interest on your notes. Furthermore, on May 24, 2018, President Trump signed into law the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer ProtectionAct, which repealed or amended certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. See “Additional Legal Aspects of the Origination Trust and the Transaction SUBI—Dodd-Frank Orderly Liquidation Framework” in this prospectus.On March 25, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the“CARES Act”) was signed into law. The CARES Act is extensive and significant legislation, and the majority of implementing regulations have not yet been issued. The potential impact of the CARES Act on VW Credit and its affiliatesor on the lessees of the leases in the pool is not yet known. It is possible that compliance with the implementing regulations under the CARES Act may impose costs on, or create operational constraints for, VW Credit and may have an adverse impacton the ability of VW Credit to effectively service the leases. Further, certain governmental authorities, including Federal, state or local governments, could enact, and in some cases already have enacted, laws, regulations, executive orders orother guidance that allow lessees to defer scheduled payments, require modifications to the leases (e.g., waiving accrued interest), preclude creditors from exercising certain rights or taking certain actions with respect to collateral, includingrepossession or liquidation of the financed vehicles or mandate limited operations or temporary closures of the servicer or its vendors as “non-essential businesses” or otherwise.The CARES Act provided for the creation of the Federal Pandemic UnemploymentCompensation program, which provided an additional $600 per week to individuals collecting traditional unemployment compensation. This benefit was available for weeks of unemployment ending on or before July 31, 2020. The President of theUnited States has since authorized a similar benefit, at a reduced level, as well as a deferral of certain payroll tax collections through the end of 2020. However, VW Credit cannot predict the impact of the reduced unemployment benefit or thefailure by Congress to renew or initiate other relief measures. In addition, it is not known how many lessees may have been receiving any such additional unemployment benefits, or what the effect of any reduction of such benefits may be on theability of the lessees to meet their payment obligations under the leases allocated to the Transaction SUBI.Failure to comply with consumer protection laws could result in a loss.Federal and state consumer protection laws, including the federal Consumer Leasing Act of 1976 and Regulation M promulgated by the CFPB regulate the creation, collection and enforcement of retail lease contracts such as the leases.Additionally, the CARES Act includes various provisions, such as new requirements affecting credit reporting, designed to protect consumers. However, the majority of implementing regulations under the CARES Act have not yet been issued. Although theliability of the issuing entity to the lessee for violations of applicable federal and state consumer laws may be limited, these laws may make an assignee of a lease, such as the origination trust, liable to the lessee for any violation by the lender.Under certain circumstances, the liability of the origination trust to the lessee for violations of applicable federal and state consumer protection laws may be limited by the applicable law. In some cases, this liability could affect anassignee’s ability to enforce its rights related to the leases. The failure by the origination trust to comply with applicable law may give rise to liabilities on the part of the origination trust or the issuing entity (as owner of theTransaction SUBI). Further, many states have adopted “lemon laws”that provide vehicle users certain rights in respect of substandard vehicles. A successful claim under a lemon law could result in, among other things, the termination of the related lease and/or the requirement that a portion of payment previouslypaid by the lessee be refunded. VW Credit will represent and warrant that each lease complies with applicable law in all material respects as of the cutoff date. If that representation and warranty relating to any lease allocated to the TransactionSUBI proves incorrect, materially and adversely affects the interests of the issuing entity or the noteholders and is not timely cured, VW Credit will be required to repurchase the beneficial interest in the noncompliant lease and related leasedvehicle from the issuing entity. To the extent that VW Credit fails to make such a repurchase, or to the extent that a court holds the origination trust or the issuing entity liable for violating consumer protection laws regardless of such arepurchase, a failure to comply with consumer protection laws could result in required payments by the origination trust or the issuing entity. If sufficient funds are not available to make both payments to lessees and on your notes, you may suffera loss on your investment in the notes. For a discussion of federal and stateconsumer protection laws which may affect the leases, you should refer to “Material Legal Aspects of the Leases and the Leased Vehicles—Consumer Protection Laws” in this prospectus.Changes to federal or state bankruptcy or debtor relief laws may impede collection efforts or alter the timing and amount of collections, which may result in acceleration of or reduction in payment on your notes.If a lessee sought protection under federal or state bankruptcy or debtor relief laws, a court could reduce or discharge completely the lessee’s obligations to repay amounts due on its lease. As a result, that lease would bewritten off as uncollectible. It is likely that a higher percentage of lessees will seek protection under bankruptcy or debtor relief laws as a result of financial and economic disruptions related to the outbreak ofCOVID-19 than is reflected in the sponsor’s historical experience. See “—Credit scores and historical loss experience may not accurately predict the likelihood of losses on theleases.” You could suffer a loss if no funds are available from credit enhancement or other sources and finance charge amounts allocated to the notes are insufficient to cover the applicable default amount.Exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union may adversely affect the performance of the leases and could result in losses or delays in payments or losses on your notes. The UK ceased to be a member of the EU on January 31, 2020 (such withdrawal from the EU being commonly referred to as“Brexit”). This withdrawal took place in accordance with a withdrawal agreement, which provides for the Transition Period. During the Transition Period, EU law continues to apply to and in the UK, any reference to “memberstates” in such EU law shall be understood as including the UK and the UK will continue to have access to the EU single market.The UK and the EU have commenced negotiations with regard to the terms of their future relationship. There remains considerable uncertainty surrounding howsuch negotiations may develop and whether they will have a negative impact on the UK, on the broader global economy and on the value of the British pound. The future effects of Brexit will in largepart be dependent on the outcome of these negotiations between the UK and the EU and the extent to which the UK retains access to EU markets at the end of the Transition Period.Following the conclusion of the Transition Period the UK will no longer be considered a“member state” of the EU and EU law will no longer apply to and in the UK. There is therefore uncertainty as to the scope, nature and terms of the relationship between the UK and the EU that will apply after the end of the TransitionPeriod. The political, legal and regulatory uncertainty surrounding the possibility that no agreement is reached by the end of the Transition Period, or as regards the terms of the future relationship between the UK and the EU if an agreement isreached, has raised concerns that Brexit could adversely affect economic and market conditions in the UK, in the EU and elsewhere, and could introduce potentially significant uncertainty and instability in global financial markets.The results of these events may significantly impact the volatility, liquidity and/ormarket value of securities and other financial instruments, including the notes.Requirements for certain European regulated investors and affiliates. The EU Securitization Regulation is directly applicable in member states of the EU and will be applicable in any non-EU states of the EEA in which it is implemented. Notwithstanding the UK’s withdrawal from the EU on January 31, 2020, the EU Securitization Regulation also continues to apply in the UK following suchdate until December 31, 2020 under the terms of the withdrawal agreement negotiated between the EU and the UK (the “Transition Period”); but it is currently expected that, with effect from the end of the Transition Period, theEU Securitization Regulation will cease to be applicable in the UK and certain similar UK legislation will take effect.Article 5 of the EU Securitization Regulation places certain conditions (the “EU Due Diligence Requirements”) on investments in, or otherexposures to, “securitisations” (as defined in the EU Securitization Regulation) by “institutional investors”, defined to include (a) a credit institution or an investment firm as defined in and for purposes of Regulation(EU) No 575/2013, as amended, known as the Capital Requirements Regulation (the “CRR”), (b) an insurance undertaking or a reinsurance undertaking as defined in Directive 2009/138/EC, as amended, known as Solvency II, (c) analternative investment fund manager as defined in Directive 2011/61/EU that manages and/or markets alternative investment funds in the EU or (during the Transition Period) the UK, (d) an undertaking for collective investment in transferablesecurities (“UCITS”) management company, as defined in Directive 2009/65/EC, as amended, known as the UCITS Directive, or an internally managed UCITS, which is an investment company that is authorized in accordance with thatDirective and has not designated such a management company for its management, and (e) with certain exceptions, an institution for occupational retirement provision falling within the scope of Directive (EU) 2016/2341, or an investment manageror an authorized entity appointed by such an institution for occupational retirement provision as provided in that Directive. Pursuant to Article 14 of the CRR, the EU Due Diligence Requirements also apply to investments by certain consolidatedaffiliates, wherever established or located, of institutions regulated under the CRR (such affiliates, together with all institutional investors, the “Affected Investors”).Pursuant to the EU Due Diligence Requirements, an Affected Investor investing in asecuritization must, amongst other things, verify (a) that the originator, sponsor or original lender retains a material net economic interest of not less than 5% in such securitization in accordance with the EU Securitization Regulation,(b) that the originator, sponsor or issuer has, where applicable, made available information as required by the EU Securitization Regulation, and (c) that certain credit-granting requirements are satisfied.Although VW Credit will retain credit risk in accordance with Regulation RR asdescribed in this prospectus under “The Sponsor—Credit Risk Retention”, none of VW Credit, the depositor, the underwriters, any of their affiliates or any other party to the transaction described in this prospectus will(a) retain or commit to retain a 5% material net economic interest with respect to this transaction in accordance with the EU Securitization Regulation or (b) take or refrain from taking any action to facilitate or enable compliance by anyperson with the EU Due Diligence Requirements, or with the requirements of any other law or regulation now or hereafter in effect in the EU, any EEA member state or the UK, in relation to risk retention, due diligence and monitoring, credit grantingstandards or any other conditions with respect to investments in securitization transactions.Failure by an Affected Investor to comply with the EU Due Diligence Requirements with respect to an investment in the Notes may result in the imposition of apenalty regulatory capital charge on such investment or of other regulatory sanctions by the competent authority of such Affected Investor. Consequently, the notes may not be a suitable investment for Affected Investors, and this may affect theprice and liquidity of the notes. Prospective investors are responsible foranalyzing their own regulatory position and should consult with their own investment and legal advisors regarding the application of the EU Securitization Regulation or other applicable regulations and the suitability of the Notes forinvestment. Risks Relating to the NotesRetention of some or all of one or more classes of notes by the depositor or an affiliate of the depositor may reduce the liquidity of such notes.Some or all of one or more classes of notes may be retained or purchased by the depositor or an affiliate of the depositor. Accordingly, the market for such a retained class of notes may be less liquid than would otherwise be thecase. In addition, if any retained notes are subsequently sold in the secondary market, demand and market price for notes of that class already in the market could be adversely affected. Additionally, if any retained notes are subsequently sold inthe secondary market, the voting power of the noteholders of the outstanding notes may be diluted.The failure to make principal payments on any notes will generally not result in an indenture default until the applicable final scheduled payment date.The amount of principal required to be paid on a note prior to the applicable final scheduled payment date generally will be limited to amounts available for those purposes. Therefore, the failure to pay principal of a notegenerally will not result in an indenture default until the final scheduled payment date for the applicable notes.VW Credit, the servicer and the depositor have limited obligations to the issuing entity and will not make VW Credit, the servicer, the depositor and their affiliates are not obligated to make any payments to you on your notes. However, VW Credit will make representations and warranties about certain characteristics ofthepayments on the notes. leases and leased vehicles allocated to the related Transaction SUBI.If a representation or warranty made by VW Credit is untrue, then VW Credit may berequired to repurchase the beneficial interest in that lease and the related leased vehicle. In addition, in some circumstances, the servicer may be required to purchase the beneficial interest in leases and leased vehicles if certain covenants madeby the servicer with respect to the leases or leased vehicles is breached. While VW Credit or the servicer may be obligated to reallocate or repurchase any beneficial interest in a lease and related leased vehicle if there is a breach of any oftheir respective representations and warranties or covenants, as applicable, relating thereto which materially and adversely affects the interests of the issuing entity, there can be no assurance given that VW Credit or the servicer, as applicable,will financially be in a position to fund its repurchase obligation and you might experience delays or reductions in payments on your notes. Further, absent a breach of a representation and warranty (but only if such breach is not cured andmaterially and adversely affects the interests of the issuing entity or the noteholders), or a breach of a servicing covenant specifically requiring reallocation, VW Credit will have no obligation to repurchase the beneficial interest in any leaseor related leased vehicle for which the related lessee was adversely affected by the outbreak of COVID-19 (including in the event the related lease is extended or modified after the cutoff date).Returns on your investments may be reduced by prepayments on the leases, events of default, optional redemption of the notes or reallocations of the leases and leased vehicles from the Transaction SUBI. You may receive payments on your notes earlier than you expected for the reasons set forth below. You may not be able to invest the amountspaid to you earlier than you expected at a rate of return that is equal to or greater than the rate of return on your notes.•  The rate of return of principal is uncertain. The amount of distributions of principal of yournotes and the time when you receive those distributions depend on the rate of payments and losses on the leases and the leased vehicles, which cannot be predicted with certainty. Prepayments, liquidations of defaulted leases or reallocations fromthe Transaction SUBI of leases and the related vehicles that do not meet certain eligibility criteria will shorten the life of the notes to an extent that cannot be predicted. Further, the leases allocated to the Transaction SUBI may be prepaid, infull or in part, voluntarily or as a result of defaults, theft of or damage to the related leased vehicles or for other reasons. For example, a lessee under certain circumstances may elect to terminate the lease prior to its maturity. Each of thesepayments will have the effect of accelerating the payment of principal and shortening the average lives of the notes. The servicer cannot predict the actual prepayment rates for the leases, and VW Credit’s historical prepayment experience maynot reflect circumstances similar to the current global outbreak of COVID-19. You will bear any reinvestment risk resulting from a faster or slower rate of payments of the leases and leased vehicles.•  You may be unable to reinvestdistributions in comparable investments. The occurrence of an optional redemption or an indenture default resulting in acceleration may require repayment of the notes prior to the expected principal payment date for one or more classes of notes.Asset-backed securities, like the notes, usually produce a faster return of principal to investors as market      interest rates fall and produce a slower return of principal whenmarket interest rates rise. As a result, you are likely to receive more money to reinvest at a time when other investments generally are producing a lower yield than that on your notes, and are likely to receive less money to reinvest when otherinvestments generally are producing a higher yield than that on your notes. You will bear the risk that the timing and amount of distributions on your notes will prevent you from attaining your desired yield.•  An early redemption of thenotes from an optional redemption will shorten the life of your investment which may reduce your yield to maturity. If the Transaction SUBI is sold upon exercise of a “clean-up call” by thedepositor, the issuing entity will redeem the notes and you will receive the remaining principal amount of your notes plus any other amounts due to noteholders, such as accrued interest through the related payment date. Because your notes will nolonger be outstanding, you will not receive the additional interest payments or other distributions that you would have received had the notes remained outstanding. If you bought your notes at par or at a premium, your yield to maturity will belower than it would have been if the optional redemption had not been exercised. See “Description of the Transaction Documents—Redemption of the Notes” in this prospectus for a more detailed description of the depositor’s “clean-up call” option.You must rely for repayment only upon the issuing entity’s assets which may not be sufficient to make full payments on your notes.Your notes are secured solely by the assets of the issuing entity. Your notes will not represent an interest in or an obligation of VW Credit, the origination trust, the depositor or any of their respective affiliates. VW Credit andthe servicer may have a limited obligation to repurchase the beneficial interest in some leases and related leased vehicles under some circumstances as described in this prospectus. Distributions on any class of notes will depend solely on theamount and timing of payments and other collections in respect of the leases and the credit enhancement described herein. We cannot assure you that these amounts, together with sales proceeds of the related leased vehicles, will be sufficient tomake full and timely distributions on your notes. The notes and the leases will not be insured or guaranteed, in whole or in part, by the United States or any governmental entity or any other party. General Risk FactorsRisk of loss or delay in payment may result from delays in the transfer of servicing due to the servicing fee structure.Because the servicing fee is structured as a percentage of the aggregate securitization value of the leases and leased vehicles, the amount of the servicing fee payable to the servicer may be considered insufficient by potentialreplacement servicers if servicing is required to be transferred at a time when much of the outstanding aggregate securitization value of the leases and leased vehicles has been repaid. Due to the reduction in servicing fee as described in theforegoing, it may be difficult to find a replacement servicer. Consequently, the time it takes to effect the transfer of servicing to a replacement servicer under such circumstances may result in delays and/or reductions in the interest andprincipal payments on your notes.You may experience a loss or a delay in receiving payments on the notes if theIf certain indenture defaults occur and the notes are accelerated, the indenture trustee may liquidate the assets of the issuing entity. If aassets of the issuing entity are liquidated.liquidation occurs close to the date when any class otherwise would have been paid in full, repayment of that class might be delayed while liquidation of the assets is occurring. The issuing entity cannot predict the length of timethat will be required for liquidation of the assets of the issuing entity to be completed. In addition, liquidation proceeds may not be sufficient to repay the notes in full. Even if liquidation proceeds are sufficient to repay the notes in full,any liquidation that causes the outstanding principal amount of a class of notes to be paid before the related final scheduled payment date will involve the prepayment risks described under “Risk Factors—Returns on your investments maybe reduced by prepayments on the leases, events of default, optional redemption of the notes or reallocations of the leases and leased vehicles from the Transaction SUBI” in this prospectus.Your share of possible losses may not be proportional.Principal payments on the notes generally will be made to the holders of the notes sequentially so that no principal will be paid on any class of notes until each class of notes with an earlier final scheduled payment date has beenpaid in full. As a result, a class of notes with a later maturity may absorb more losses than a class of notes with an earlier maturity.Prepayments, potential losses and a change in the order of priority of principal payments may result from an indenture default. An indenture default may result in payments on your notes being accelerated. As a result:•   you may suffer losseson your notes if the assets of the issuing entity are insufficient to pay the amounts owed on your notes;•   payments on your notes may be delayed until more senior classes of notes are repaid;and •   your notes maybe repaid earlier than scheduled, which may require you to reinvest your principal at a lower rate of return.The absence of a secondary market could limit your ability to resell your notes.If you want to sell your notes you must locate a purchaser that is willing to purchase those notes. The underwriters intend to make a secondary market for the notes. The underwriters will do so by offering to buy the notes frominvestors that wish to sell. However, the underwriters will not be obligated to make offers to buy the notes and may stop making offers at any time. In addition, the prices offered, if any, may not reflect prices that other potential purchaserswould be willing to pay, were they to be given the opportunity. There have been times in the past, including recently, where there have been very few buyers of asset-backed securities, and there may be these times again in the future. As a result,you may not be able to sell your notes when you want to do so or you may not be able to obtain the price that you wish to receive.Lack of liquidity in the secondary market may adversely affect the ability to sell your notes.Recent and, in some cases, continuing events in the global financial markets, including the current COVID-19 pandemic, the failure, acquisition or government seizure of several major financialinstitutions, the establishment of government bailout programs for financial institutions, problems related to subprime mortgages and other financial assets, the de-valuation of various assets in secondary markets, the forced sale of asset-backedand other securities as a result of the de-leveraging of structured investment vehicles, hedge funds, financial institutions and other entities, the lowering of rates on certain asset-backed securities andBrexit and the related uncertainty surrounding the future of the UK’s relationship with the EU, have caused a significant reduction in liquidity in the secondary marketfor asset-backed securities. This period of illiquidity may continue, and even worsen, and may adversely affect the value of your notes. As a result of the foregoing, you may not be able to sell your notes when you want to do so oryou may not be able to obtain the price you wish to receive. See “Risk Factors—The absence of a secondary market for the notes could limit your ability to resell your notes” in this prospectus.The ratings of the notes may be withdrawn or lowered, or the notes may receive an unsolicited rating, which may have an adverse effect on the liquidity or the market price of the notes. Ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold the notes. Rather, ratings are an assessment by the applicable rating agency of thelikelihood that any interest on a class of notes will be paid on a timely basis and that a class of notes will be paid in full by its final scheduled payment date. Ratings do not consider to what extent the notes will be subject to prepayment orthat the principal of any class of notes will be paid prior to the final scheduled payment date for that class of notes, nor do the ratings consider the prices of the notes or their suitability to a particular investor. A rating agency may revise orwithdraw the ratings at any time in its sole discretion, including as a result of a failure by the sponsor to comply with its obligation to post information provided to the Hired Agencies on a website that is accessible by a rating agency that isnot a Hired Agency. The ratings of the notes may be lowered by a rating agency (including the Hired Agencies) following the initial issuance of the notes as a result of losses on the leases in excess of the levels contemplated by a rating agency atthe time of its initial rating analysis. Neither the depositor nor the sponsor nor any of their respective affiliates will have any obligation to replace or supplement any credit support, or to take any other action to maintain any ratings of thenotes. Accordingly, there is no assurance that the ratings assigned to any note onthe closing date will not be lowered or withdrawn by any rating agency at any time thereafter. If any rating with respect to the notes is revised or withdrawn, the liquidity or the market value of your note may be adversely affected.It is possible that other rating agencies not hired by the sponsor may provide anunsolicited rating that differs from (or is lower than) the rating provided by the Hired Agencies. As of the date of this prospectus, the depositor was not aware of the existence of any unsolicited rating provided (or to be provided at a futuretime) by any rating agency not hired to rate the transaction. However, there can be no assurance that an unsolicited rating will not be issued prior to or after the closing date, and none of the sponsor, the depositor nor any underwriter isobligated to inform investors (or potential investors) in the notes if an unsolicited rating is issued after the date of this prospectus. Consequently, if you intend to purchase any notes, you should monitor whether an unsolicited rating of thenotes has been issued by a non-hired rating agency and should consult with your financial and legal advisors regarding the impact of an unsolicited rating on a class of notes. If any non-hired rating agency provides an unsolicited rating that differs from (or is lower than) the rating provided by the Hired Agencies, the liquidity or the market value of your note may be adverselyaffected.Potential rating agency conflict of interest and regulatory scrutiny.The Hired Agencies have been hired by the sponsor to provide their ratings on the notes. We note that a rating agency may have a conflict of interest where, as is the case with the ratings of the notes by the Hired Agencies, thesponsor or the issuer of a security pays the fee charged by the rating agency for its rating services. Furthermore, rating agencies, including the Hired Agencies, have been and may continue to be under scrutiny by federalandstate legislative and regulatory bodies for their roles in the financial crisis and such scrutiny and any actions such legislative and regulatory bodies may take as a result thereof may also have an adverse effect on the marketvalue of the notes and your ability to resell your notes.Because the notes are in book-entry form, your rights can only be exercised indirectly. Because the notes will initially be issued in book-entry form, you will be required to hold your interest in your notes through TheDepository Trust Company in the United States, or Clearstream Banking, société anonyme or Euroclear Bank S.A./NV as operator of the Euroclear System in Europe or Asia. Transfers of interests in the notes within The Depository TrustCompany, Clearstream Banking, société anonyme or Euroclear Bank/S.A./NV as operator of the Euroclear System must be made in accordance with the usual rules and operating procedures of those systems. So long as the notes are inbook-entry form, you will not be entitled to receive a definitive note representing your interest. The notes will remain in book-entry form except in the limited circumstances described under the caption “The Notes—DefinitiveNotes” in this prospectus. Unless and until the notes cease to be held in book-entry form, the transaction parties will not recognize you as a holder of the notes.As a result, you will only be able to exercise the rights as a noteholder indirectly through The Depository Trust Company (if in the United States) and itsparticipating organizations, or Clearstream Banking, société anonyme and Euroclear Bank S.A./NV as operator of the Euroclear System (in Europe or Asia) and their participating organizations. Holding the notes in book-entry form couldalso limit your ability to pledge or transfer your notes to persons or entities that do not participate in The Depository Trust Company, Clearstream Banking, société anonyme or Euroclear Bank S.A./NV as operator of the EuroclearSystem. In addition, having the notes in book-entry form may reduce their liquidity in the secondary market since certain potential investors may be unwilling to purchase securities for which they cannot obtain physical notes.Interest on and principal of the notes will be paid by the issuing entity to TheDepository Trust Company as the record holder of notes while they are held in book-entry form. The Depository Trust Company will credit payments received from the issuing entity to the accounts of its participants which, in turn, will credit thoseamounts to noteholders either directly or indirectly through indirect participants. This process may delay your receipt of principal and interest payments from the issuing entity.The notes may not be a suitable investment for you.The notes are not a suitable investment for you if you require a regular or predictable schedule of payments or payment on any specific date. The notes are complex investments that should be considered only by investors who, eitheralone or with their financial, tax and legal advisors, have the expertise to analyze the prepayment, reinvestment, default and market risks, the tax consequences of an investment in the notes and the interaction of these factors.Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Before deciding whether to invest in our common stock,you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below. You should also consider the risks, uncertainties and assumptions discussed under the heading “Risk Factors” included in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and our subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, each of which is on file with the SEC and are incorporated herein by reference, and which may be amended, supplementedor superseded from time to time by other reports we file with the SEC in the future. There may be other unknown or unpredictable economic, business, competitive, regulatory or other factors that could have material adverse effects on our futureresults. If any of these risks actually occurs, our business, business prospects, financial condition or results of operations could be seriously harmed. This could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline, resulting in a loss of allor part of your investment. Please also read carefully the section above entitled “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.” Risks Related to This Offering and Our Common Stock The market price of our common stock may be highly volatile, and you may not be able to resell your shares at orabove the offering price. Our stock price is likely to be volatile. Since our initial public offeringin June 2018, or our IPO, the trading price of our common stock has ranged from $9.76 to $53.70. The stock market in general, and the market for biopharmaceutical companies in particular, has experienced extreme volatility that has often beenunrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. As a result of this volatility, you may not be able to sell your common stock at or above the price at which you purchase shares. The market price for our common stock may be influencedby many factors, including: • adverse results or delays in preclinical studies or clinical trials;• reports of adverse events in other gene therapy products or clinical studies of suchproducts; • an inability to obtain additional funding; • failure by us to successfully develop and commercialize our product candidates;• failure by us to maintain our existing strategic collaborations or enter into newcollaborations; • failure by us or our licensors and strategic partners to prosecute, maintain or enforce ourintellectual property rights; • changes in laws or regulations applicable to future products; • an inability to obtain adequate product supply for our product candidates or the inabilityto do so at acceptable prices; • adverse regulatory decisions; • the introduction of new products, services or technologies by our competitors;• failure by us to meet or exceed financial projections we may provide to the public;• failure by us to meet or exceed the financial projections of the investment community;• the perception of the pharmaceutical industry by the public, legislatures, regulators andthe investment community; • announcements of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures orcapital commitments by us, our strategic partner or our competitors; • disputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents,litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies; • additions or departures of key scientific or management personnel;• significant lawsuits, including patent or stockholder litigation;• changes in the market valuations of similar companies; • sales of our common stock by us or our stockholders in the future; and• the trading volume of our common stock. In addition, companies trading in the stock market in general, and The Nasdaq Global Select Market in particular, haveexperienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock,regardless of our actual operating performance. We could be subject to securities class actionlitigation. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a companyfollowing a decline in the market price of its securities. This risk is especially relevant for us because pharmaceutical companies have experienced significant stock price volatility in recent years. If we face such litigation, it could result insubstantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources, which could harm our business. An active trading market for our common stock may not be sustained. Althoughour common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Global Select Market, an active trading market for our shares may never be sustained. If an active market for our common stock is not sustained, it may be difficult for you to sell shares you purchase in thisoffering without depressing the market price for the shares, or at all. An inactive trading market may alsoimpair our ability to raise capital to continue to fund operations by selling additional shares and may impair our ability to acquire other companies or technologies by using our shares as consideration. If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about ourbusiness, our share price and trading volume could decline. The trading market for our common stockwill likely depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. Although we have obtained research coverage from certain analysts, therecan be no assurance that analysts will continue to cover us or provide favorable coverage. If one or more analysts downgrade our stock or change their opinion of our stock, our share price would likely decline. In addition, if one or more analystscease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline. Concentration of ownership of our common stock among our existing executive officers, directors and principalstockholders may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions. Based onshares outstanding as of September 30, 2020, our executive officers, directors, five percent stockholders and their affiliates beneficially owned approximately 28% of our outstanding voting stock. As a result, if these stockholders were to acttogether, they would be able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, as well as our management and affairs. For example, these stockholders, acting together, may be able to control elections of directors, amendments of ourorganizational documents, or approval of any merger, sale of assets, or other major corporate transaction. This may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that you may believe are in your best interestas one of our stockholders. Some of these persons or entities may have interests different than yours. For example, because many of these stockholders purchased their shares at prices substantially below the price at which you may purchase our shares and have held their shares for a longer period, they may be moreinterested in selling our company to an acquirer than other investors or they may want us to pursue strategies that deviate from the interests of other stockholders. We are an “emerging growth company,” and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerginggrowth companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors. We are an “emerginggrowth company,” or EGC, as defined in the JOBS Act. We will remain an EGC until the earliest of: (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1.07 billion or more; (ii) the last day of thefiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the completion of our IPO; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or (iv) the date on which weare deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC, which means the first day of the year following the first year in which the market value of our common stock that is held bynon-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of June 30. For so long as we remain an EGC, we are permitted and intend to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to otherpublic companies that are not emerging growth companies. These exemptions include: • not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or Section 404; • not being required to comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public CompanyAccounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements; • being permitted to provide only two years of audited financial statements, in addition toany required unaudited interim financial statements, with correspondingly reduced “Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” disclosure; • reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation; and• an exemption from the requirement to seek nonbinding advisory votes on executivecompensation or golden parachute arrangements. We may choose to take advantage of some,but not all, of the available exemptions. We have taken advantage of reduced reporting burdens. In particular, we have not included all of the executive compensation information that would be required if we were not an EGC. We cannot predict whetherinvestors will find our common stock less attractive if we rely on certain or all of these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stockprice may be reduced or more volatile. In addition, the JOBS Act provides that an EGC may take advantage ofan extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This allows an EGC to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to availourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will not be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. Even after we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, we may still qualify as a “smaller reportingcompany” if the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates is below $250 million (or $700 million if our annual revenue is less than $100 million) as of June 30 in any givenyear, which would allow us to take advantage of many of the same exemptions from disclosure requirements. If you purchase our common stock in this offering, you will incurimmediate and substantial dilution in the book value of your shares. Investors purchasing shares ofcommon stock in this offering will pay a price per share that substantially exceeds the as adjusted book value per share of our tangible assets after subtracting our liabilities. As a result, investors purchasing shares of common stock in thisoffering will incur immediate dilution of $8.29 per share, based on the public offering price of $15.00 per share, and our as adjusted net tangible book value as of September 30, 2020. Further, based on these assumptions, investors purchasingshares of common stock in this offering will contribute approximately 14.3% of the total amount invested by stockholders since our inception, but will own only approximately 12.1% of the shares of common stock outstanding. For information on how theforegoing amounts were calculated, see “Dilution.” You may experience future dilution as aresult of future equity offerings. In order to raise additional capital, we may in the future offeradditional shares of our common stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock at prices that may not be the same as the price per share in this offering. We may sell shares or other securities in any other offeringat a price per share that is less than the price per share paid by investors in this offering, and investors purchasing shares or other securities in the future could have rights superior to those of existing stockholders. The price per share atwhich we sell additional shares of our common stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into common stock, in future transactions may be higher or lower than the price per share paid by investors in this offering. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price tofall. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or theperception that these sales might occur could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We are unable to predict the effect that such sales may haveon the prevailing market price of our common stock. In addition, the sale of substantial amounts of our common stock could adversely impact its price. As of September 30, 2020, we had outstanding 36,449,153 shares of our common stock, optionsto purchase 5,658,890 shares of our common stock (of which 1,754,340 were exercisable as of that date) and 1,342 shares of common stock issuable upon the vesting of restricted stock units (none of which were vested as of that date). The sale or theavailability for sale of a large number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause the price of our common stock to decline. While our directors and officers and certain stockholders affiliated with one of our directors haveentered into lock-up agreements in connection with this offering, these lock-up agreements include, among other exceptions, an exception for sales or other dispositions of shares of our common stock pursuant to 10b5-1 plans in place on the date ofthis prospectus, and as a result, a significant number of shares of our common stock currently held by such parties could be sold in the public market during the applicable restricted period under such agreements. See “Underwriting”.We have broad discretion in the use of the net proceeds from this offering and may not use themeffectively. Our management will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds fromthis offering, including for any of the purposes described in the section entitled “Use of Proceeds,” and you will not have the opportunity as part of your investment decision to assess whether the net proceeds are being usedappropriately. Because of the number and variability of factors that will determine our use of the net proceeds from this offering, their ultimate use may vary substantially from their currently intended use. The failure by our management to applythese funds effectively could harm our business. Pending their use, we may invest the net proceeds from this offering in short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing securities. These investments may not yield a favorable return to ourstockholders. We do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock so any returnswill be limited to the value of our stock. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on ourcommon stock. We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Any return tostockholders will therefore be limited to the appreciation of their stock. For example, our prior loan facility with Silicon Valley Bank restricted our ability to pay any dividends or making any distributions on account of our capital stock, and wemay enter into agreements in the future with similar restrictions. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future. Changes in tax law could adversely affect our business and financial condition. The rules dealing with U.S. federal, state, and local income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved inthe legislative process and by the Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Treasury Department. Changes to tax laws (which changes may have retroactive application) could adversely affect us or holders of our common stock. In recent years, many suchchanges have been made and changes are likely to continue to occur in the future. Future changes in tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition orresults of operations. We urge investors toconsult with their legal and tax advisers regarding the implications of potential changes in tax laws on an investment in our common stock. Our bylaws contain exclusive forum provisions, which may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in ajudicial forum it finds favorable and may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. Ouramended and restated bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any state law claim for (1) any derivative action orproceeding brought on our behalf; (2) any action asserting a claim of breach of or based on a fiduciary duty owed by any of our current or former directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders; (3) any action asserting aclaim against us or any of our current or former directors, officers, employees or stockholders arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended andrestated bylaws; or (4) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, or the Delaware Forum Provision. The Delaware Forum Provision will not apply to any causes of action arising under the Securities Act or theExchange Act. Our amended and restated bylaws further provide that, unless we consent in writing to an alternative forum, the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaintasserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act, or the Federal Forum Provision, as our principal executive offices are located in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In addition, our amended and restated bylaws provide that any person or entitypurchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock is deemed to have notice of and consented to the foregoing Delaware Forum Provision and the Federal Forum Provision; provided, however, that stockholders cannot and willnot be deemed to have waived our compliance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. We recognize that the Delaware Forum Provision and the Federal Forum Provision may impose additional litigation costs on stockholders who assert the provision is not enforceable and may impose more general additional litigationcosts in pursuing any such claims, particularly if the stockholders do not reside in or near the State of Delaware or the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Additionally, these forum selection clauses in our amended and restated bylaws may limit ourstockholders’ ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that they find favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees eventhough an action, if successful, might benefit our stockholders. While the Delaware Supreme Court ruled in March 2020 that federal forum selection provisions purporting to require claims under the Securities Act be brought in federal court are“facially valid” under Delaware law, there is uncertainty as to whether other courts will enforce our Federal Forum Provision. The Federal Forum Provision may also impose additional litigation costs on stockholders who assert the provision is unenforceable, and if the Federal Forum Provision is found to be unenforceable, wemay incur additional costs with resolving such matters. The Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts may also reach different judgments or results than would other courts,including courts where a stockholder considering an action may be located or would otherwise choose to bring the action, and such judgments may be more or less favorable to us than our stockholders. An investment in our securities is subject to risks inherentto our business. The material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect us are described below. Before making aninvestment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other informationincluded or incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus. The risks and uncertaintiesdescribed below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are not aware of or focused on or thatwe currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. We also update risk factors from time to time in our periodicreports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K which will be incorporated by reference to this prospectus supplement and the accompanyingprospectus. If any of the following risks actually occur, our financial condition and results of operations could be materiallyand adversely affected. If this were to happen, the value of our common stock could decline significantly, and you could lose allor part of your investment.Risks Relatingto this Offering and Our SecuritiesWe may allocate net proceedsfrom this offering in ways which differ from our estimates based on our current plans and assumptions discussed in the sectionentitled “Use of Proceeds” and with which you may not agree.The allocation of net proceeds of theoffering set forth in the “Use of Proceeds” section below represents our estimates based upon our current plans andassumptions regarding industry and general economic conditions, our future revenues and expenditures. The amounts and timing ofour actual expenditures will depend on numerous factors, including market conditions, cash generated by our operations, businessdevelopments and related rate of growth. We may find it necessary or advisable to use portions of the proceeds from this offeringfor other purposes. Circumstances that may give rise to a change in the use of proceeds and the alternate purposes for which theproceeds may be used are discussed in the section entitled “Use of Proceeds” below. You may not have an opportunityto evaluate the economic, financial or other information on which we base our decisions on how to use our proceeds. As a result,you and other stockholders may not agree with our decisions. See “Use of Proceeds” below for additional information.Investors will suffer immediate and substantial dilutionas a result of this offering.Investors of shares of our common stock offered by this prospectussupplement and the accompanying prospectus will suffer immediate and substantial dilution of their investment. Based on the publicoffering price of $30.00 per share and our net tangible book value as of September 30, 2020, if you purchase shares of common stockin this offering, you will suffer immediate and substantial dilution of $26.94 per share, with respect to the net tangible bookvalue of the common stock. See “Dilution” in this prospectus supplement for a more detailed discussion of the dilutionthat investors will incur in this offering.Future financings could adversely affect common stockownership interest and rights in comparison with those of other security holders.Our board of directors has the power to issue additional sharesof common or preferred stock without stockholder approval. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity or convertibledebt securities, the percentage of ownership of our existing stockholders will be reduced, and these newly issued securities mayhave rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders. If we issue additional shares of common stockor securities convertible into common stock, such issuance will reduce the proportionate ownership and voting power of each otherstockholder. In addition, such stock issuances might result in a reduction of the book value of our common stock.Future sales by our stockholdersmay adversely affect our stock price and our ability to raise funds in new stock offerings.Sales of our common stock by our stockholdersand warrant, option or preferred stock holders following this offering could lower the market price of our common stock. Salesmay also make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities or equity-related securities in the future at a time and pricethat our management deems acceptable or at all.S-4Sales of a significant number of shares of common stockin the public markets, or the perception that such sales could occur, could depress the market price of our shares of common stock.Sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock in thepublic markets could depress the market price of our shares of common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through thesale of additional equity securities. We cannot predict the effect that future sales of our shares of common stock would have onthe market price of our shares of common stock.The market price of our common stock may be adverselyaffected by market conditions affecting the stock markets in general, including price and trading fluctuations on Nasdaq.Market conditions may result in volatility in the level of,and fluctuations in, market prices of stocks generally and, in turn, our common stock and sales of substantial amounts of our commonstock in the market, in each case being unrelated or disproportionate to changes in our operating performance. A weak global economyor other circumstances, such as changes in tariffs and trade, could also contribute to extreme volatility of the markets, whichmay have an effect on the market price of our common stock.We are not currently paying dividends and will likelynot pay dividends for the foreseeable future.We have never paid or declared any cash dividends on our commonstock. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings to fund the development and expansion of our business,and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination to pay cash dividends willbe at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements,contractual restrictions and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant.Our business could be negatively impacted by the recentCoronavirus (“COVID-19”) outbreak or other similar outbreaks.The recent outbreak of COVID-19, and any other outbreaks ofcontagious diseases or other adverse public health developments in countries where we operate or our customers are located, couldhave a negative effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. These effects could include disruptionsor restrictions on our employees’ ability to work effectively, as well as temporary closures of our facilities or the facilitiesof our customers or suppliers. This could affect our performance on our contracts. Resulting cost increases may not be fully recoverableor adequately covered by insurance, which could impact our profitability. In addition, the outbreak of COVID-19 has resulted ina widespread health crisis that is adversely affecting the economies and financial markets of many countries, which could resultin an economic downturn that may negatively affect demand for our products. The extent to which COVID-19 could impact our business,results of operations and financial condition is highly uncertain and will depend on future developments. Such developments mayinclude the geographic spread and duration of the virus, the severity of the disease and the actions that may be taken by variousgovernmental authorities and other third parties in response to the outbreak.S-5CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKINGSTATEMENTSThis prospectus supplement, the accompanying prospectus andthe documents we have filed with the SEC that are incorporated by reference into this prospectus supplement and the accompanyingprospectus contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the“Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).Forward-looking statements reflect our current view about future plans, intentions or expectations.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for working capital and other general corporate purposes.The allocation of the net proceeds of the offering set forthabove represents our estimates based upon our current plans and assumptions regarding industry and general economic conditions,our future revenues and expenditures.The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will dependupon numerous factors, including market conditions, cash generated by our operations, business developments and related rate ofgrowth. We may find it necessary or advisable to use portions of the proceeds from this offering for other purposes.Circumstances that may give rise to a change in the use of proceedsand the alternate purposes for which the proceeds may be used include:•the existence of other opportunities or the need to take advantage of changes in timing of our existing activities;•the need or desire on our part to accelerate, increase or eliminate existing initiatives due to, among other things, changing market conditions and competitive developments; and/or•if strategic opportunities of which we are not currently aware present themselves (including acquisitions, joint ventures, licensing and other similar transactions).From time to time, we evaluate these and other factors and weanticipate continuing to make such evaluations to determine if the existing allocation of resources, including the proceeds ofthis offering, is being optimized. Pending such uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds of this offering in direct and guaranteedobligations of the United States, interest-bearing, investment-grade instruments or certificates of deposit.S-7DILUTIONIf you invest in our common stock, you will experience dilutionto the extent of the difference between the price per share you pay in this offering and the net tangible book value per shareof our common stock immediately after this offering.Our net tangible book value as of September 30, 2020, was approximately$15 million, or $2.16 per share of common stock. Net tangible book value per share is equal to our total tangible assets minustotal liabilities, all divided by the number of shares of common stock outstanding as of September 30, 2020. After giving effectto the sale of shares of common stock by us in this offering at a price of $30.00 per share, and after deducting the underwritingdiscount and commissions, and estimated offering expenses payable by us, our as adjusted net tangible book value would have beenapproximately $22 million, or approximately $3.06 per share of common stock, as of September 30, 2020. This represents an immediateincrease in net tangible book value of approximately $0.90 per share to existing stockholders and an immediate dilution of approximately$26.94 per share to new investors. The following table illustrates this calculation on a per share basis:Public offering price per share$30.00 Net tangible book value per share as of September 30, 2020$2.16Increase in net tangible book value per share attributable to this offering$0.90 As adjusted net tangible book value per share after this offering$3.06 Dilution per share to new investors participating in this offering$(26.94) The number of shares of common stock to be outstanding immediatelyafter this offering as shown above is based on 7,722,517 shares of Common Stock outstanding as of November 23, 2020, and excludes(i) 325,308 shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of stock options outstanding under our equity incentive plans, as a weightedaverage exercise price of $9.31 per share; (ii) 2,500 shares reserved for issuance under our equity incentive plans; and (iii)1,482,150 shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of warrants outstanding.The above illustration of dilution per share to investors participatingin this offering assumes no exercise of outstanding options or warrants to purchase shares of our common stock. The exercise ofoutstanding options or warrants having an exercise price less than the offering price will increase dilution to new investors.In addition, we may choose to raise additional capital due tomarket conditions or strategic considerations, even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operatingplans. To the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuanceof these securities could result in further dilution to our stockholders.S-8CAPITALIZATIONThe following table sets forth our capitalization as of September30, 2020, as follows:·on an actual basis; and·on an as adjusted basis assuming the issuance and sale of shares of common stock in this offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.You should read this table together with the section of thisprospectus supplement entitled “Use of Proceeds” and with the financial statements and related notes and the otherinformation that we incorporated by reference into this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus, including our AnnualReport on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q that we file with the SEC from time to time.At September 30, 2020As ReportedPro Forma(Unaudited)(in thousands, except per share amounts)Debt$0$0Stockholders’ Equity (Deficit):Preferred stock; $0.001 par value; 10,000,000 shares authorized; 0 shares issued and outstanding as reported, 0 pro forma00Common stock, $0.001 par value; 9,800,000 shares authorized; 6,778,827 shares issued and outstanding as reported77 Additional paid in capital63,57270,461 Accumulated (deficit)(48,686)(48,686)Total stockholders’ equity$14,893$21,782 The table above excludes (i) 305,308 shares of common stockissuable upon exercise of stock options outstanding under our equity incentive plans, as a weighted average exercise price of $8.78per share; (ii) 327,808 shares reserved for issuance under our equity incentive plans; and (iii) 2,384,340 shares of common stockissuable upon exercise of warrants outstanding.S-9UNDERWRITINGWe are offering the shares of common stock described in thisprospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus through the underwriter listed below.

We invent, design, engineer, manufacture and sell solar powered productsthat enable vital and highly valuable services in locations where it is either too expensive or too impactful to connect to theutility grid, or where the requirements for electrical power are so important that grid failures, like blackouts, are intolerable.When competing with utilities or typical solar companies, we rely on our products’ deployability, reliability, accessibility,portability and total cost of ownership, rather than simply producing the cheapest kilowatt hour with the help of subsidies asmost competing solar companies do.Envision’s solarpowered products and proprietary technology solutions target three markets that are experiencing significant growth with annualglobal spending in the billions of dollars.·electric vehicle charging infrastructure;·outdoor media advertising; and·energy security and disaster preparedness.2The Company focuseson creating renewable, high-quality products for electric vehicle (“EV”) and drone charging, outdoor media and branding,and energy security that are rapidly deployable and attractively designed. We believe that there is a clear need for a rapidlydeployable and highly scalable EV charging infrastructure, and that our EV ARC™ and Solar Tree™ products fulfill thatrequirement. We are agnostic as to the EV charging service equipment (“EVSE”) as we do not sell EV charging, ratherwe sell products which enable it. Our EV ARC™ and Solar Tree™ products replace the infrastructure required to supportEV chargers, not the chargers themselves.We believe our chiefdifferentiators are:•our ability to invent, design,engineer, and manufacture solar powered products which dramatically reduce the cost, time and complexity of the installation andoperation of EV charging infrastructure and outdoor media platforms when compared to traditional, utility grid tied alternatives;•our products’ capabilityto operate during grid outages and to provide a source of emergency power rather than becoming inoperable during times of emergencyor other grid interruptions; and•our ability to create new andpatentable inventions which are marketable and a complex integration of our own proprietary technology and parts, and other commonlyavailable engineered components, creating a further barrier to entry for our competition.Envisionwas formed in June 2006 as a limited liability company. Through a series of transactions and mergers, including a series of 2010transactions where the then existing entity was acquired by an inactive publicly-held company in a transaction treated as a recapitalizationof the company, the resulting entity became Envision Solar International, Inc., a Nevada Corporation.

Before deciding whether to invest in our common stock, you shouldcarefully consider the risks described below and the risks described under “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, as amended on Form 10-K/A, as well as the other risks and uncertainties described in the other documents incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus and the information containedin our other filings with the SEC, which are incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus in their entirety, and in any free writing prospectus that we have authorized for use in connection with thisoffering. If any of these risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow could be seriously harmed. This could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline, resulting in a loss of all or partof your investment. Risks Related to Our IndebtednessIf we are unable to raise additional capital when required or on acceptable terms, the repayment of our existing indebtedness could be accelerated, whichraises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Based on our current projections, following thecompletion of this offering, assuming we sell $50,000,000 of shares of our common stock pursuant to this prospectus supplement, we anticipate that we will need to raise additional capital in order to maintain compliance with the minimum unrestrictedcash balance requirement of our financing agreement with Sixth Street Partners, or the Financing Agreement. In order to address our projected capital needs, we are pursuing various financing and other alternatives including the sale of a controllinginterest in vitaCare Prescription Services for which we commenced a sale process and received initial indications of interest. However, we cannot guarantee that future financing sufficient to maintain or exceed the minimum unrestricted cash balanceunder the Financing Agreement will be available in sufficient amounts, in a timely fashion, or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we are unable to maintain the minimum unrestricted cash balance or otherwise comply with any other covenant ofthe Financing Agreement (including the total minimum net revenue requirements), all or a portion of our obligations under the Financing Agreement may be declared immediately due and payable, which would have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness, results of operations and financial condition. Along with considering additional financings, we have reviewed numerouspotential scenarios in connection with the impact of COVID-19 on our business including the impact of the recent steps we have taken to reduce our operating expenses in response. Based on ouranalysis, we believe that our existing cash reserves along with potential proceeds from the sale of certain non-core assets of the Company and proceeds from potential future financings, if availableto us, would be sufficient to meet our cash needs arising in the ordinary course of business for the next twelve months from the date of this prospectus supplement. However, if we are unsuccessful with future financings and if the successfulcommercialization of IMVEXXY, BIJUVA, or ANNOVERA is delayed, or the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business is worse than we anticipate, our existing cash reserves would beinsufficient to maintain compliance with the Financing Agreement covenants or satisfy our liquidity requirements until we are able to successfully commercialize IMVEXXY, BIJUVA, and ANNOVERA. The presence of these projected factors in conjunctionwith the uncertainty of the capital markets raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for the next twelve months from the date of this prospectus supplement. Additional Risks Related to this Offering and our Common Stock Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock, or the perception that such sales might occur, could adversely affect the trading price ofour common stock. As of September 30, 2020, we had 272,812,271 shares of our common stock outstanding. Also, we had, as ofSeptember 30, 2020, up to 41,303,594 shares of our common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding options, restricted stock units, performance stock units and warrants. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market following this offering could cause themarket price of our common stock to decline. Although there can be no assurance that any of the $50,000,000 worth of shares being offered under this prospectus supplement will be sold or the price at which any such shares might be sold, assumingthat an aggregate of 37,313,433 shares of our common stock are sold during the term of the sales agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald, in each case, for example, at a price of $1.34 per share, the last reported sale price of our common stock on theNasdaq Global Select Market on November 25, 2020, upon completion of this offering, based on our shares outstanding as of September 30, 2020, including the 26,953,125 shares of common stock we issued in connection with our November 2020underwritten public offering of common stock, we will have outstanding an aggregate of 337,078,829 shares of common stock, assuming no exercise or settlement, as the case may be, of our outstanding stock options, restricted stock units, performancestock units or warrants. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock, or the perception that such sales might occur, could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. Further, sales of shares underlying stock options,restricted stock units, performance stock units and warrants, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock. You may experience immediate and substantial dilution in the book value per share of the common stock you purchase and may experience further dilutionin the future as a result of equity offerings and other issuances of our common stock or other securities. The offering price pershare in this offering may exceed the net tangible book value per share of our common stock outstanding prior to this offering. Assuming that an aggregate of 37,313,433 shares of our common stock are sold in this offering at a price of $1.34 pershare, the last reported sale price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on November 25, 2020, for aggregate gross proceeds of $50,000,000, and after deducting commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us, you willexperience immediate dilution of $1.70 per share, representing the difference between our as adjusted net tangible book value per share as of September 30, 2020 after giving effect to this offering and the assumed offering price. The exerciseof outstanding stock options and warrants and the settlement of outstanding restricted stock units and performance stock units will result in further dilution of your investment. See the section entitled “Dilution” below for a moredetailed illustration of the dilution you would incur if you participate in this offering. To raise additional capital, we may in thefuture offer additional shares of our common stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock at prices that may not be the same as the price per share in this offering. We cannot assure you that we will be able tosell shares or other securities in any other offering at a price per share that is equal to or greater than the price per share paid by investors in this offering, and investors purchasing shares or other securities in the future could have rightssuperior to existing stockholders. As of September 30, 2020, there were outstanding options representing the right to purchase atotal of 23,893,180 shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $4.80 per share, 6,029,957 shares of common stock underlying outstanding restricted stock units, up to 4,845,770 shares of common stock underlying outstandingperformance stock units, outstanding warrants representing the right to purchase a total of 6,534,687 shares of our common stock at a weighted-average exercise price of $1.83 per share, 3,465,514 shares of our common stock reserved for futureissuance under our non-qualified stock option plans and 5,400,000 shares of common stock reserved for future issuance under our employee stock purchase plan. You will incur dilution upon exercise ofany outstanding stock options or warrants or upon the issuance of shares of common stock under our stock incentive programs. In addition,the sale of shares in this offering and any future sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales may occur, could adversely affect the price of our common stock. We cannot predictthe effect, if any, that market sales of those shares of common stock or the availability of those shares of common stock for sale will have on the market price of our common stock. We have broad discretion to determine how to use the proceeds raised in this offering, and we may notuse the proceeds effectively. Our management will have broad discretion over the use of proceeds from this offering, and we couldspend the proceeds from this offering in ways with which you may not agree or that do not yield a favorable return. We intend to use a majority of the net proceeds from this offering for commercialization of IMVEXXY, BIJUVA and ANNOVERA, includingto maximize ANNOVERA’s consumer-focused commercialization strategy. We additionally intend to use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering for working capital and general corporate purposes. If we do not invest or apply the proceeds ofthis offering in ways that improve our operating results, we may fail to achieve expected financial results, which could cause our stock price to decline. It is not possible to predict the aggregate proceeds resulting from sales made under the sales agreement. Subject to certain limitations in the sales agreement and compliance with applicable law, we have the discretion to deliver a placement noticeto Cantor Fitzgerald at any time throughout the term of the sales agreement. The number of shares that are sold through Cantor Fitzgerald after delivering a placement notice will fluctuate based on a number of factors, including the market price ofour common stock during the sales period, any limits we may set with Cantor Fitzgerald in any applicable placement notice and the demand for our common stock. Because this offering can be terminated at any time and the price per share of each sharesold pursuant to the sales agreement will fluctuate over time, it is not currently possible to predict the aggregate proceeds to be raised in connection with sales under the sales agreement. Sales of common stock offered hereby will be in “at the market offerings,” and investors who buy shares at different times will likely paydifferent prices. Investors who purchase shares in this offering at different times will likely pay different prices, andaccordingly may experience different levels of dilution and different outcomes in their investment results. We will have discretion, subject to market demand, to vary the timing, prices and number of shares sold in this offering. In addition,subject to the final determination by our board of directors or any restrictions we may place in any applicable placement notice delivered to Cantor Fitzgerald, there is no minimum or maximum sales price for shares to be sold in this offering.Investors may experience a decline in the value of the shares they purchase in this offering as a result of sales made at prices lower than the prices they paid.

Some of the keyfactors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations include the following: • the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic; • whether we will be able to comply with the covenants and conditions under our term loan facility;• whether we will be able to successfully divest our vitaCare business and the proceeds that may be generated bysuch divestiture; • our ability to maintain or increase sales of our products; • our ability to develop and commercialize IMVEXXY, ANNOVERA, BIJUVA and our hormone therapy drug candidates andobtain additional financing necessary therefor; • the potential of adverse side effects or other safety risks that could adversely affect the commercialization ofour current or future approved products or preclude the approval of our future drug candidates; • the length, cost and uncertain results of future clinical trials; • our reliance on third parties to conduct our clinical trials, research and development and manufacturing;• our ability to protect our intellectual property, including with respect to the Paragraph IV notice letters wereceived regarding IMVEXXY and BIJUVA;• the ability of our licensees to commercialize and distribute our products; • the effects of laws, regulations and enforcement; • the competitive nature of the industries in which we conduct our business; • the availability of reimbursement from government authorities and health insurance companies for our products;• the impact of product liability lawsuits; • the influence of extensive and costly government regulation; • whether the FDA will approve the efficacy supplement for the lower dose of BIJUVA; • the ability of our marketing contractors to market ANNOVERA; • the volatility of the trading price of our common stock; and • the concentration of power in our stock ownership. USE OF PROCEEDS The amount of proceeds from this offering will depend upon the number of shares of our common stock sold and the market price at which theyare sold. There can be no assurance that we will be able to sell any shares under or fully utilize the sales agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald as a source of financing. We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to for commercialization of IMVEXXY, BIJUVA and ANNOVERA, including to maximizeANNOVERA’s consumer-focused commercialization strategy, and for working capital and general corporate purposes. As of the date ofthis prospectus supplement, we cannot specify with certainty all of the particular uses of the proceeds from this offering. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend on numerous factors, including the progress ofcommercialization activities, the timing of our revenue and the amount of cash used by our operations. Accordingly, we will retain broad discretion over the use of such proceeds. DILUTION Purchasers of common stock in this offering will experience immediate dilution to the extent of the difference between the purchase price pershare of common stock, and the net tangible book value per share of common stock immediately after this offering. Our net tangible bookvalue as of September 30, 2020 was approximately $(158.5) million, or $(0.58) per share. Net tangible book value per share is determined by dividing our total tangible assets, less total liabilities, by the number of shares of our commonstock outstanding as of September 30, 2020. Dilution in net tangible book value per share represents the difference between the amount per share paid by purchasers of shares of common stock in this offering and the net tangible book value pershare of our common stock immediately after this offering. After giving effect to the sale of shares of common stock offered by theprospectus supplement at an assumed purchase price of $1.34 per share of common stock (the last reported sale price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on November 25, 2020), and after deducting the commissions and estimatedaggregate offering expenses payable by us, our net tangible book value as of September 30, 2020 would have been approximately $(111.2) million, or $(0.36) per share of common stock. This represents an immediate increase in net tangible bookvalue of $0.22 per share to our existing stockholders and an immediate dilution of $1.70 per share of common stock issued to the new investors purchasing securities in this offering. The following table illustrates this per share dilution:  Assumed purchase price per share of common stock$1.34 Net tangible book deficit per share as of September 30, 2020$(0.58)  Increase per share attributable to new investors$0.22 As adjusted net tangible book value per share after this offering$(0.36)  Dilution per share to new investors$1.70The table above assumes for illustrative purposes that an aggregate of 37,313,433 shares of our common stockare sold at a price of $1.34 per share, the last reported sale price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on November 25, 2020, for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $50,000,000. The shares sold in this offering, if any,will be sold from time to time at various prices. An increase of $1.00 per share in the price at which the shares are sold from the assumed offering price of $1.34 per share shown in the table above, assuming all of our common stock in the aggregateamount of $50,000,000 is sold at that price, would result in an as adjusted net tangible book value per share after this offering of approximately $(0.38) per share and would increase the dilution in net tangible book value per share to newinvestors to $2.72 per share, after deducting commissions and estimated aggregate offering expenses payable by us. A decrease of $1.00 per share in the price at which the shares are sold from the assumed offering price of $1.34 per share shown inthe table above, assuming all of our common stock in the aggregate amount of $50,000,000 is sold at that price, would result in an as adjusted net tangible book value per share after this offering of approximately $(0.26) per share and woulddecrease the dilution in net tangible book value per share to new investors to $0.60 per share, after deducting commissions and estimated aggregate offering expenses payable by us. The information discussed above is illustrative only and may differ based on the actual offering price and the actual number of sharesoffered. The number of shares of common stock to be outstanding immediately after this offering is based on 272,812,271 sharesoutstanding on September 30, 2020 and excludes the following as of that date: • outstanding options representing the right to purchase a total of 23,893,180 shares of common stock at a weightedaverage exercise price of $4.80 per share; • 6,029,957 shares of common stock underlying outstanding restricted stock units; • up to 4,845,770 shares of common stock underlying outstanding performance stock units; • outstanding warrants representing the right to purchase a total of 6,534,687 shares of common stock at aweighted-average exercise price of $1.83 per share; • 3,465,514 shares of common stock reserved for future issuance underour non-qualified stock option plans; • 5,400,000 shares of common stock reserved for future issuance under our employee stock purchase plan; and• 26,953,125 shares of common stock issued in connection with our November 2020 underwritten public offering ofcommon stock. To the extent that outstanding options or warrants are exercised or we issue shares of common stock underour stock incentive plans, investors purchasing our common stock in this offering will experience further dilution. In addition, we may choose to raise additional capital due to market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe wehave sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. To the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of these securities could result in further dilution to ourstockholders. CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF NEVADA LAW AND OUR CHARTER AND BYLAWS The following paragraphs summarize certain provisions of Nevada law and our amended and restated articles of incorporation, as amended, andbylaws. The summary does not purport to be complete and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to Nevada law and to our amended and restated articles of incorporation, as amended, and bylaws, as amended, copies of which are on filewith the SEC as exhibits to reports previously filed by us. See “Where You Can Find More Information.” Limitations of Liability andIndemnification of Officers and Directors Our amended and restated articles of incorporation, as amended, limit the liability ofdirectors and officers and provides that no director or officer of ours will be personally liable to us or any of our stockholders for damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director or officer involving any act or omission of any act by suchdirector or officer, other than (i) for acts or omissions which involve intentional misconduct, fraud, or a known violation of the law, or (ii) the payment of dividends in violation of Section 78.300 of the NRS. In addition, ouramended and restated articles of incorporation, as amended, provide that we will indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by law. We are a Nevada corporation and generally governed by the Nevada Private Corporations Code, Chapter 78 of the Nevada Revised Statutes, or NRS.Section 78.138 of the NRS provides that, unless the corporation’s articles of incorporation provide otherwise, a director orofficer is not individually liable to the corporation or its stockholders or creditors for damages as a result of any action or omission to act as a director or officer unless the presumption that the director or officer acted in good faith, on aninformed basis and with a view to the interests to the corporation is rebutted and it is proven that (i) the director’s or officer’s acts or omissions constituted a breach of his or her fiduciary duties, and (ii) such breachinvolved intentional misconduct, fraud, or a knowing violation of the law. Section 78.7502 of the NRS permits a company to indemnifyits directors and officers against expenses, judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred in connection with a threatened, pending, or completed action, suit, or proceeding, if the officer or director (i) isnot liable pursuant to Section 78.138 of the NRS, or (ii) acted in good faith and in a manner the officer or director reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and, if a criminal action orproceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe the conduct of the officer or director was unlawful. A discretionary indemnification pursuant to Section 78.7502 may be made as authorized in the specific case upon a determination by thestockholders, the disinterested board members, or, under certain circumstances, by independent legal counsel. Indemnification under Section 78.7502 of the NRS may not be made the corporation if the officer or director has been adjudged by acourt of competent jurisdiction, after exhaustion of any appeals, to be liable to the corporation or for amounts paid in settlement to the corporation, unless and only to the extent that the court determines that in view of all the circumstances,the person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses. Section 78.751 of the NRS requires a corporation toindemnify its officers and directors to the extent that they have been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding (whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative) or any claim, issue or mattertherein, but also provides that discretionary indemnification may not be made under Section 78.7502 of a director or officer finally adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction, after exhaustion of any appeals, to be liable for intentionalmisconduct, fraud or a knowing violation of law, and such misconduct, fraud or violation was material to the cause of action. Section 78.751 of the NRS permits a Nevada corporation to indemnify its officers and directors against expenses incurred in defending acivil or criminal action, suit, or proceeding as they are incurred and in advance of final disposition thereof. Section 78.751 of the NRS providesthat, unless restricted by the articles of incorporation, the bylaws or an agreement made by the corporation, the corporation may (or shall, if required by the articles of incorporation, bylaws or an agreement) pay expenses as incurred and in advance of final disposition of the action, suit or proceeding, upon receipt of an undertaking by or onbehalf of the officer or director to repay the amount if it is ultimately determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that such officer or director is not entitled to be indemnified by the corporation. Section 78.751 of the NRS furtherpermits the corporation to grant its directors and officers additional rights of indemnification under its articles of incorporation, bylaws, or other agreement. We have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and executiveofficers. Section 78.752 of the NRS provides that a Nevada corporation may purchase and maintain insurance or make other financialarrangements on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee, or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee, or agent of another company, partnership, jointventure, trust, or other enterprise, for any liability asserted against him and liability and expenses incurred by him in his capacity as a director, officer, employee, or agent, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the corporationhas the authority to indemnify him against such liability and expenses. We have obtained primary and excess insurance policies insuring our directors and officers and our subsidiaries against certain liabilities they may incur in their capacity asdirectors and officers. Under such policies, the insurer, on our behalf, may also pay amounts for which we have granted indemnification to the directors or officers. The foregoing discussion of indemnification merely summarizes certain aspects of indemnification provisions and is limited by reference to theabove discussed sections of the Nevada Private Corporations Code. Our amended and restated articles of incorporation, as amended, providethat we shall, to the fullest extent permitted by the provisions of the Nevada Private Corporations Code, indemnify any and all persons whom we have the power to indemnify from and against any and all expenses, liabilities and other matters referredto in or covered by such provisions. Insofar as indemnification by our company for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to officers and directors of our company pursuant to the foregoing provisions or otherwise, we are awarethat in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION We have entered into a Controlled Equity OfferingSM Sales Agreement, or the SalesAgreement, with Cantor Fitzgerald  Co., or Cantor Fitzgerald, under which we may offer and sell shares of our common stock. Pursuant to this prospectus supplement, we may offer and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate grosssales price of up to $50,000,000 from time to time through Cantor Fitzgerald acting as agent. The Sales Agreement has been filed as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K. This summary of the materialprovisions of the Sales Agreement does not purport to be a complete statement of its terms and conditions. Upon delivery of a placementnotice and subject to the terms and conditions of the Sales Agreement, Cantor Fitzgerald may offer and sell shares of our common stock by any method permitted by law deemed to be an “at the market offering” as defined in Rule 415(a)(4)promulgated under the Securities Act, including sales made directly on Nasdaq or any other existing trading market for our common stock. We may instruct Cantor Fitzgerald not to sell common stock if the sales cannot be effected at or above the pricedesignated by us from time to time. We or Cantor Fitzgerald may suspend or terminate the offering of our common stock upon notice and subject to other conditions. We will pay Cantor Fitzgerald commissions, in cash, for its services in acting as agent in the sale of our common stock. Cantor Fitzgerald isentitled to compensation at a commission rate of 3.0% of the gross proceeds from each sale of our common stock. Because there is no minimum offering amount required as a condition to this offering, the actual total public offering amount,commissions and proceeds to us, if any, are not determinable at this time. We have also agreed to reimburse a portion of Cantor Fitzgerald’s expenses, including legal fees, in connection with this offering up in an amount not to exceed $50,000.A financial advisor will receive a cash fee in connection with this offering. The financial advisor is not acting as a sales agent and will not sell or offer to sell any securities and will not identify, solicit, or engage directly with potentialinvestors. In addition, the financial advisor will not underwrite or purchase any of the offered shares or otherwise participate in any such undertaking. We estimate that the total expenses for the offering under this prospectus supplement,excluding compensation and reimbursements payable to Cantor Fitzgerald under the terms of the Sales Agreement, will be approximately $1,130,000. Settlement for sales of shares of common stock will occur on the second business day following the date on which any sales are made, or onsome other date that is agreed upon by us and Cantor Fitzgerald in connection with a particular transaction, in return for payment of the net proceeds to us. Sales of our common stock as contemplated in this prospectus supplement will be settledthrough the facilities of The Depository Trust Company or by such other means as we and Cantor Fitzgerald may agree upon. There is no arrangement for funds to be received in an escrow, trust or similar arrangement. Cantor Fitzgerald will use its commercially reasonable efforts, consistent with its sales and trading practices and applicable law andregulations, to solicit offers to purchase the shares of common stock under the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Sales Agreement. In connection with the sale of the shares of common stock on our behalf, Cantor Fitzgerald will bedeemed to be an “underwriter” within the meaning of the Securities Act and the compensation of Cantor Fitzgerald will be deemed to be underwriting commissions or discounts. We have agreed to provide indemnification and contribution toCantor Fitzgerald (and its partners, members, directors, officers, employees and agents) against certain civil liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. The offering of shares of our common stock pursuant to the Sales Agreement will terminate upon the termination of the Sales Agreement aspermitted therein. We and Cantor Fitzgerald may each terminate the Sales Agreement at any time upon five days’ prior notice. CantorFitzgerald and its affiliates may in the future provide various investment banking, commercial banking and other financial services for us, our subsidiaries and our affiliates, for which services they may in the future receive customary fees.

RISK FACTORS Investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the discussionof risks and uncertainties under the heading “Risk Factors” contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, which is incorporated by reference in thisprospectus, and under similar headings in our subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and annual reports on Form 10-K, as well as the other risks anduncertainties described in any applicable prospectus supplement or free writing prospectus and in the other documents incorporated by reference in this prospectus. See the sections entitled “Where You Can Find More Information” and“Incorporation of Certain Information by Reference” in this prospectus. The risks and uncertainties we discuss in this prospectus, in any applicable prospectus supplement or free writing prospectus and in the other documents incorporatedby reference in this prospectus are not the only ones facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business, financialcondition and results of operations. Please also refer to the section of this prospectus titled “Cautionary Statement About Forward Looking Statements.” Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Before investing in our common stock, you should consider carefully the risks described below and under the heading “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2020, as well as any amendment or update to our risk factors reflected in subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, which are incorporated by reference into this prospectus supplement, together with the other information contained in this prospectus supplement, the accompanying prospectus and in our other filings with the SEC that we have incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus. If any of these risks occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In these circumstances, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. Risks Related to this Offering Market Price of Common Stock There has been relatively limited trading volume in the market for our common stock, and there can be no assurance that a more active trading market for our shares of common stock will develop or be sustained after this offering. Securities of precious metal exploration companies have experienced substantial volatility in the past, often based on factors unrelated to the financial performance or prospects of the companies involved. These factors include macroeconomic developments in North America and globally, and market perceptions of the attractiveness of particular industries. The price of our securities is also likely to be significantly affected by short-term changes in commodity prices and specifically the price of gold and silver, other precious metal prices or other mineral prices, currency exchange fluctuation, or in our financial condition or results of operations as reflected in our quarterly earnings reports. Additionally, broad market fluctuations may cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities, securities class-action litigation has often been brought against that company. We may become involved in this type of litigation in the future. Litigation of this type may be expensive to defend and may divert our management’s attention and resources from the operation of our business. You may experience future dilution as a result of future equity offerings. In order to raise additional capital, we may in the future offer additional shares of common stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock at prices that may not be the same as the price per share in this offering. We may sell shares or other securities in any other offering at a price per share that is less than the price per share paid by investors in this offering, and investors purchasing shares or other securities in the future could have rights superior to existing stockholders. The price per share at which we sell additional shares of our common stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into common stock, in future transactions may be higher or lower than the price per share paid by investors in this offering. We have broad discretion in the use of our cash and cash equivalents, including the net proceeds we receive in this offering, and may not use them effectively. Our management has broad discretion to use our cash and cash equivalents, including the net proceeds we receive in this offering, to fund our operations and could spend these funds in ways that do not improve our results of operations or enhance the value of our common stock. The failure by our management to apply these funds effectively could result in financial losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, cause the price of our common stock to decline and delay the development of the Grassy Mountain Project. Pending their use to fund our operations, we may invest our cash and cash equivalents, including the net proceeds from this offering, in a manner that does not produce income or that loses value. Because we have no current plans to pay cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future, you may not receive any return on investment unless you sell your common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it. We intend to retain future earnings, if any, for future operations and expansion of our business and have no current plans to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. The declaration, amount and payment of any future dividends on shares of common stock will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors may take into account general and economic conditions, our financial condition, and results of operations, our available cash and current and anticipated cash needs, capital requirements, contractual, legal, tax and regulatory restrictions, implications on the payment of dividends by us to our stockholders or by our subsidiaries to us and such other factors as our Board of Directors may deem relevant. In addition, our ability to pay dividends is limited by covenants of our existing and outstanding indebtedness and may be limited by covenants of any future indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur. As a result, you may not receive any return on an investment in our common stock unless you sell our common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it. If securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they downgrade our stock or our sector, our stock price and trading volume could decline. The trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. We do not control these analysts. Furthermore, if one or more of the analysts who do cover us downgrades our stock or our industry, or the stock of any of our competitors, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our stock could decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of the Company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.
