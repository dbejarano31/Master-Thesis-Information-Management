Noachis Terra is a party to a worldwide, nonexclusive intellectual\\nproperty and biological materials license agreement with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (“NIAID”),\\nan institute within the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”), relating to certain research, patent applications and\\nbiological materials involving pre-fusion coronavirus spike proteins and their use in the development and commercialization of\\nvaccine to provide specific, long lasting immunity from SARS-CoV-2.</p>\\n<p>Coronaviruses\\nare a family of viruses that can, when transmitted to humans, lead to upper-respiratory infections. Recent clinical reports also\\nsuggest that the SARS-CoV-2 virus can affect other body-systems, including the nervous, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and renal\\nsystems. Among the recent iterations of coronaviruses to move from animal to human carriers is SARS-CoV-2 (often referred to as\\nCOVID-19), which, beginning in Wuhan, China, in late 2019, caused a global pandemic due to its rapid spread and the relatively\\nhigh mortality rate (as compared to the seasonal influenza). In early October of 2020, the World Health Organization’s estimates\\nindicate the number of worldwide COVID-19 infections have exceeded 36,000,000 and the number of deaths directly attributed to\\nCOVID-19 have exceeded 1,000,000. Aside from Remdesivir, no governmental regulatory authority in the United States has\\napproved a vaccine or anti-viral treatment specifically targeting SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19. We intend to combine the research,\\npatent applications and biological materials covered by our NIAID license with our existing clinical research and manufacturing\\ncapabilities to respond rapidly to this ongoing, global, public health crisis.</p>\\n<p>Coronaviruses, such as SARS -CoV-2, possess signature protein spikes on their outer capsule. The NIAID license covers patents and data\\non a vaccine candidate that were created based on a stabilized pre-fusion spike trimeric protein. By stabilizing the spike protein\\nin the pre-fusion state, the number of immunogenic centers is increased thereby allowing for a greater likelihood of successful\\nantibody binding, resulting in an improved immunogenic response. The genetic code, acquired from the NIH, for the stabilized pre-fusion\\nspike protein was provided to Aragen Bioscience, Inc. (“Aragen”) for the purpose of insertion of the spike protein\\ngene sequence into a Chinese Hamster Ovary (“CHO”) cell line. Aragen is a leading contract research organization focused\\non accelerating preclinical biologics product development, has extensive experience building CHO cell lines for recombinant proteins,\\nsuch as monoclonal antibodies. Aragen has successfully inserted the NIH pre-fusion spike protein gene sequence into a CHO cell\\nline and is currently developing both the analytical tests and identifying preliminary cell line growth conditions to optimize\\nthe spike protein titers. Currently, “mini-pool” production and analytical development is underway. The transfer to\\nfull-scale manufacture has begun.</p>\\n<table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\"><tr><td>S-4</td></tr></table>\\n<p>The\\nNIH’s preclinical study shows that this spike protein, adjuvanted with the mouse specific TLR-4-agonist Sigma Adjuvant System\\n(“SAS”, a TLR-4 agonists) that induces T cell activation), generates neutralizing antibody titers in both a pseudovirus\\nneutralization assay and a plaque reduction neutralization titer (PRNT) assay. In October 2020, we received feedback to our Type\\nB Pre-IND Meeting Request from the FDA. The response indicated that the FDA broadly supported our planned approach to the pre-clinical\\nprogram that will support the clinical development of the Terra CoV-2, vaccine. As a result, we believe the timelines for both\\nfiling an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application and the commencement of the Phase 1 study will proceed on schedule.\\nWe anticipate filing the IND in the second quarter of 2021 and immediately upon the receipt of approval from the FDA, commencing\\nthe Phase 1 clinical study.</p>\\n<p>We\\nexpect to use our currently available cash resources to continue to advance the development of TerraCoV2 with full development\\nbeing contingent upon the receipt of additional equity funding.</p>\\n<p><i>Our\\nAntibiotic Product Candidate-OG716</i></p>\\n<p>Members\\nof our scientific team discovered that a certain bacterial strain,<i> streptococcus mutans, </i>produces\\nMU1140, a molecule belonging to the novel class of antibiotics known as lantibiotics. Lantibiotics, such as MU1140, are highly\\nmodified peptide antibiotics made by a small group of Gram-positive bacterial species. Approximately 60 lantibiotics have been\\ndiscovered, to date. We believe lantibiotics are generally recognized by the scientific community to be potent antibiotic agents.</p>\\n<p>In\\nnonclinical testing, MU1140 has shown activity against all Gram-positive bacteria against which it has been tested, including\\nthose responsible for a number of healthcare associated infections, or HAIs. A high percentage of hospital-acquired infections\\nare caused by highly resistant bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or multidrug-resistant Gram-negative\\nbacteria. We believe the need for novel antibiotics is increasing as a result of the growing resistance of target pathogens to\\nexisting FDA approved antibiotics on the market along with the increased use of currently available antibiotics due to secondary\\ninfections in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.</p>\\n<p>Lantibiotics\\nhave been difficult to investigate for their clinical usefulness as therapeutic agents in the treatment of infectious diseases\\ndue to a general inability to produce or synthesize sufficient quantities of pure amounts of these molecules. Traditional fermentation\\nmethods can only produce minute amounts of the lantibiotic.</p>\\n<p>In\\nJune 2012, we entered into the Lantibiotic Exclusive Channel Collaboration Agreement (“Lantibiotic ECC”) with\\nPrecigen for the development and commercialization of the native strain of MU1140 and related homologs using Precigen’s\\nadvanced transgene and cell engineering platforms. Through our work with Precigen, we have been able to produce a significant\\nincrease in the fermentation titer of MU1140 compared to standard fermentation methods and have discovered a new purification\\nprocess for MU1140. Our work with Precigen generated a substantial number of homologs of MU1140. In January 2020, Precigen\\nconsummated a reorganization of its ongoing API fermentation operations and assets into EGI which at the time was an affiliate\\nof Precigen. In connection with the reorganization, Precigen assigned the Lantibiotic ECC and related stock issuance agreements\\nto EGI. Following such reorganization, Precigen divested certain of its assets to TS Biotechnology Holdings, LLC which included\\nEGI and shares of Oragenics securities held by Precigen. As a result of such change by Precigen, we expect to continue\\nour research and development and collaboration efforts with EGI to develop potential derivatives of the MU1140 molecule using\\ngenetically modified bacteria.</p>\\n<p>In\\nour pre-clinical studies to support a potential IND filing with the FDA, we tested a total of six homologs of MU1140 for certain\\ncompound characteristics, including but not limited to: drug activity (based on minimum inhibitory concentration or “MIC”)\\nequal or better than “standard of care” drugs against certain drug-resistant bacteria, safety, toxicity, stability,\\nand manufacturability. An animal study specifically evaluated homolog efficacy in relation to survival, measurable amounts of\\n<i>Clostridium difficile (“C. diff”)</i> colony forming units, and toxin levels. Three homologs demonstrated promising\\nresults with one homolog, OG253 achieving a 100% survival rate throughout the entire study in contrast to an approximately 30%\\nsurvival rate for the vancomycin positive control.</p>\\n<table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\"><tr><td>S-5</td></tr></table>\\n<p>Based\\non these early results, we selected a lead candidate, OG253, for which we had a pre-IND meeting with the FDA in November of 2015\\nregarding the pursuit of an IND for OG253. Following additional research and development on second generation lantibiotics, in\\nAugust of 2016, we opted to select a second generation lantibiotic, OG716, for treatment of <i>C. diff</i> as our new lead candidate.\\nOG716 is a new, orally-active homolog, that has exhibited positive results in an animal model for potential treatment of <i>C.\\ndiff</i>. Generated from our MU1140 platform, this new lantibiotic showed promising efficacy in reducing clinically relevant <i>C.\\ndiff</i> infections as measured by increased animal survival and decreased relapse as well as reduced production of toxins A &amp;\\nB and <i>C. diff</i> spores.</p>\\n<p>The\\ntiming of the filing of an IND regarding OG716 is subject to our having sufficient available human, material and financing capital,\\nwhich includes research subjects, both animal and human, given all of our anticipated needs and expected requirements in connection\\nwith our ongoing research and development initiatives. We will continue to advance the OG716 program to the IND filing based on\\nthe availability of both human and financial capital. Based upon the current funding available we will continue to conduct some\\nof the requisite studies. While we commenced certain of these studies at the end of 2019, we expect to focus on efficient and\\ncost-effective improvements in the manufacturing process of the product as we move to complete the pre-clinical studies required\\nto support our first in man Phase 1 clinical study.</p>\\n<p><i>Product\\nCandidates</i></p>\\n<p>Through\\nour wholly-owned subsidiary, Noachis Terra, we intend to begin the research and development stage for our new TerraCoV2 vaccine\\nproduct candidate. We hold a nonexclusive, worldwide intellectual property license agreement for certain research, patent applications\\nand biological materials relating to the use of pre-fusion coronavirus spike proteins for the development and commercialization\\nof a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2.</p>\\n<p>Additionally,\\nwe are currently working with Eleszto Genetika, Inc. (as an assignee of Precigen) to use its technology to develop lantibiotics.\\nWe seek to protect our product candidates through patents and patent applications pursuant to the terms of our license agreements.</p>\\n<p><strong>Recent\\nDevelopments</strong></p>\\n<p><strong><i>Feedback\\nFrom U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”).</i></strong> In October 2020, the Company announced the receipt of feedback\\nto its Type B Pre-IND Meeting Request from the FDA.

Such litigation, even if unsuccessful, could be costly to defend and divert management’s attention and\\nresources, which could further materially harm our financial condition and results of operations.</p>\\n<p><strong><i>If\\nyou purchase shares of our common stock sold in this offering, you will experience immediate and substantial dilution in the net\\ntangible book value of your shares. In addition, we may issue additional securities in the future, which may result in additional\\ndilution to investors.</i></strong></p>\\n<p>The\\noffering price per share of common stock in this offering is considerably more than the net tangible book value per share of our\\noutstanding common stock. As a result, investors purchasing shares of common stock in this offering will pay a price per share\\nthat substantially exceeds the value of our tangible assets after subtracting liabilities. Investors will incur immediate dilution\\nof $0.18 per share, based on the public offering price of $0.37 per share and the net tangible book value as of\\nSeptember 30, 2020. For a more detailed discussion of the foregoing, see the section entitled “Dilution” below. To\\nthe extent outstanding stock options and warrants are exercised, or convertible preferred stock converted, there will be further\\ndilution to new investors. In addition, to the extent we need to raise additional capital in the future and we issue additional\\nequity or convertible debt securities, our then existing shareholders may experience dilution and the new securities may have\\nrights senior to those of our common stock offered in this offering.</p>\\n<p><strong><i>Our\\nmanagement team may invest or spend the proceeds of this offering in ways with which you may not agree or in ways which may not\\nyield a significant return.</i></strong></p>\\n<p>Our\\nmanagement will have broad discretion over the use of proceeds from this offering. We intend to use the net proceeds from this\\noffering to fund of our Terra CoV-2 research and clinical trials for working capital and general corporate purposes. Our management\\nwill have considerable discretion in the application of the net proceeds, and you will not have the opportunity, as part of your\\ninvestment decision, to assess whether the proceeds are being used appropriately. The net proceeds may be used for corporate purposes\\nthat do not increase our operating results or enhance the value of our common stock.</p>\\n<p><strong><i>Future\\nsales of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to fall.</i></strong></p>\\n<p>The\\nmarket price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market,\\nor the perception that these sales could occur. In addition, these factors could make it more difficult for us to raise funds\\nthrough future offerings of common stock. We have recently issued a significant number of shares of common stock and the number\\nof outstanding shares has increased from 2,738,283 shares as of December 31, 2012 to 61,004,917 as of November 6, 2020. In addition,\\nthere were 16,017,133.483 shares of our Preferred stock outstanding which are convertible into shares of our common stock and\\nwarrants to purchase an additional 20,513,145 shares of our common stock issuable upon exercise of warrants to investors. There\\nwere also 5,801,349 shares issuable upon exercise of options outstanding and an additional 2,207,901 shares available for option\\ngrants under our 2012 Equity Incentive Plan.</p>\\n<table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\"><tr><td>S-12</td></tr></table>\\n<p>The\\nissuance of shares of our common stock under our 2012 Equity Incentive Plan is covered by Form S-8 registration statements we\\nfiled with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, and upon exercise of the options, such shares may be resold into the\\nmarket. We have also issued shares of common stock and warrants in connection with previous private placements. Such shares are\\navailable for resale as well as certain of the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants. We have also issued\\nshares of our common stock in the private placement and financing transaction, which are deemed to be “restricted securities,”\\nas that term is defined in Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or Securities Act, and such shares\\nmay be resold pursuant to the provisions of Rule 144. For example, on June 30, 2016 we issued 904,568 restricted shares\\nof our common stock to three accredited investors (Precigen, the KFLP and our Chairman Dr. Telling) in a private placement. The\\nresale of shares acquired from us in private transactions could cause our stock price to decline significantly. In addition, the\\nconversion of outstanding shares of Series A and Series B convertible preferred stock issued in 2017 private placements into common\\nstock and the subsequent sale of shares of common stock could also cause our stock price to decline significantly.</p>\\n<p>In\\naddition, from time to time, certain of our shareholders may be eligible to sell all or some of their restricted shares of common\\nstock by means of ordinary brokerage transactions in the open market pursuant to Rule 144, subject to certain limitations. In\\ngeneral, pursuant to Rule 144, after satisfying a six-month holding period: (i) affiliated shareholders, or shareholders whose\\nshares are aggregated, may, under certain circumstances, sell within any three-month period a number of securities which does\\nnot exceed the greater of 1% of the then-outstanding shares of common stock or the average weekly trading volume of the class\\nduring the four calendar weeks prior to such sale and (ii) non-affiliated shareholders may sell without such limitations, in each\\ncase provided we are current in our public reporting obligations. Rule 144 also permits the sale of securities by non-affiliates\\nthat have satisfied a one-year holding period without any limitation or restriction.</p>\\n<p>We\\nare unable to estimate the number of shares that may be sold because this will depend on the market price for our common stock,\\nthe personal or business circumstances of sellers and other factors.</p>\\n<p><strong><i>We\\ncannot assure you that we will continue to be listed on the NYSE American.</i></strong></p>\\n<p>Our\\ncommon stock commenced trading on the NYSE American (formerly the NYSE MKT) on April 10, 2013, and we are subject to certain NYSE\\nAmerican continued listing requirements and standards. We may also incur costs that we have not previously incurred for expenses\\nfor compliance with the rules and requirements of the NYSE American. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to continue\\nto satisfy the requirements of the NYSE American’s continued listing standards.</p>\\n<p>A\\ndelisting of our common stock from the NYSE American could negatively affect the price and liquidity of our common stock and could\\nimpair our ability to raise capital in the future.</p>\\n<p><strong><i>If\\nour common stock is not listed on a national securities exchange, U.S. holders of warrants may not be able to exercise their warrants\\nwithout compliance with applicable state securities laws and the value of your warrants may be significantly reduced.</i></strong></p>\\n<p>If\\nour common stock is delisted from the NYSE America and is not eligible to be listed on another national securities exchange, the\\nexercise of the warrants by U.S. holders may not be exempt from state securities laws. As a result, depending on the state of\\nresidence of a holder of the warrants, a U.S. holder may not be able to exercise its warrants unless we comply with any state\\nsecurities law requirements necessary to permit such exercise or an exemption applies. Although we plan to use our reasonable\\nefforts to assure that U.S. holders will be able to exercise their warrants under applicable state securities laws if no exemption\\nexists, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so. As a result, in the event that our common stock is delisted from\\nthe NYSE American and is not eligible to be listed on another securities exchange, your ability to exercise your warrants may\\nbe limited. The value of the warrants may be significantly reduced if U.S. holders are not able to exercise their warrants under\\napplicable state securities laws.</p>\\n<table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\"><tr><td>S-13</td></tr></table>\\n<p><a name=\"g_001\"></a>CAPITALIZATION</p>\\n<p>The\\nfollowing table sets forth our cash and capitalization as of September 30, 2020:</p>\\n<p>on\\nan actual basis; and</p>\\n<p>on\\nan as adjusted basis to give effect to our sale in this offering of 14,189,189 shares of common stock at $0.37 per\\nshare and after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.</p>\\n<p>You\\nshould read this table in conjunction with “Use of Proceeds” as well as our “Management’s Discussion and\\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and our consolidated financial statements, including the related\\nnotes, incorporated by reference into this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus.</p>\\n<table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\\n<tr>\\n<td colspan=\"10\">As of September 30, 2020</td></tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td colspan=\"2\">Actual</td>\\n<td colspan=\"2\">Adjustments</td>\\n<td colspan=\"2\"> As Adjusted (1)</td></tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td colspan=\"6\">(unaudited)</td></tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Cash and cash equivalents</td>\\n<td>$</td><td>10,043,613</td>\\n<td>4,673,700</td>\\n<td>14,717,313</td></tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Shareholders’ equity</td>\\n<td>9,640,345</td>\\n<td>4,673,700</td>\\n<td>14,314,045</td></tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Preferred stock, no par value; 50,000,000 shares authorized; 9,417,000 Series A shares, 6,600,000 Series B shares and 133.483 Series C shares issued and outstanding,</td>\\n<td>7,174,854</td>\\n<td>-</td>\\n<td>7,174,854</td></tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Common stock, $0.001 par value, 200,000,000 shares authorized; 61,004,917 shares issued and outstanding,</td>\\n<td>61,005</td>\\n<td>14,189</td>\\n<td>75,194</td></tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Additional paid-in capital</td>\\n<td>152,440,386</td>\\n<td>4,659,511</td>\\n<td>157,099,897</td></tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Accumulated deficit</td>\\n<td>(150,035,900</td><td>)</td>\\n<td>-</td>\\n<td>(150,035,900</td><td>)</td></tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Total liabilities and shareholders’ equity</td>\\n<td>11,282,204</td>\\n<td>4,673,700</td>\\n<td>15,955,904</td></tr>\\n</table>\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n<p>The\\nnumber of shares of our Common Stock shown above to be outstanding immediately before and after this offering is based on 61,004,917\\nshares outstanding as of September 30, 2020, and excludes, as of such date:</p>\\n<table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\\n<tr>\\n<td>●</td>\\n<td>5,801,349\\n    shares of our Common Stock subject to outstanding options having a weighted average exercise price of $0.90 per share;</td></tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>●</td>\\n<td>2,207,901\\n    shares of our Common Stock reserved for future issuance pursuant to our existing Equity Incentive Plan;</td></tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>●</td>\\n<td>20,513,145\\n    shares of our Common Stock issuable upon exercise of warrants outstanding, having a weighted average exercise price of $1.36\\n    per share;</td></tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>●</td>\\n<td>941,701\\n    shares of our Common Stock issuable upon conversion of convertible Series A Preferred stock outstanding; and</td></tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>●</td>\\n<td>1,320,002\\n    shares of our Common Stock issuable upon conversion of convertible Series B Preferred stock outstanding.</td></tr>\\n</table>\\n<p>Except\\nas otherwise indicated, all information included or incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement assumes the following:</p>\\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\\n<tr>\\n<td>●</td>\\n<td>no exercise of\\n    the outstanding options and warrants described above; and</td></tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>●</td>\\n<td>no exercise of\\n    the underwriter’s option to purchase additional shares.</td></tr>\\n</table>\\n<table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\"><tr><td>S-14</td></tr></table>\\n<p><a name=\"g_002\"></a>USE\\nOF PROCEEDS</p>\\n<p>We\\nestimate that the net proceeds from this offering will be approximately $4,673,700 after deducting our estimated offering\\nexpenses payable by us.</p>\\n<p>We\\nintend to use the net proceeds from this offering primarily to continue funding, our pre-clinical development of our SARS-CoV-2\\nvaccine, Terra CoV-2 and our lantibiotics program and for general corporate purposes, including research and development activities,\\ncapital expenditures and working capital.

AG013, is an oral rinsing solution system designed to deliver human Trefoil Factor 1 (hTFF1) to protect\\nand regenerate damaged mucosal lining of the oral cavity.</p>\\n<p>OM\\nresults in a painful inflammation and mucosal ulceration in the lining of the oral cavity, throat and esophagus and is one of\\nthe most commonly reported adverse events associated with cancer chemotherapy. Approximately 770,000 patients annually in the\\nUS are at an increased risk of developing OM according to cancer statistics provided by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) in\\n2017. OM has a negative effect on patient well-being and if severe, negatively affects adherence to a patient’s cancer treatment\\nregimen. At present, we are not aware of any drug that is approved to prevent the condition broadly and current therapies are\\nprimarily palliative in nature, only addressing symptom relief but not treating the underlying causes of the condition.</p>\\n<p>AG013\\nhas been granted Orphan Drug status in the European Union. In November of 2016, the United States Food and Drug Administration\\n(the “FDA”) granted Fast Track designation for AG013, and we believe it may be eligible for Biologic License Application\\n(“BLA”) exclusivity as well. The FDA’s fast track therapy designation program is intended to facilitate the\\ndevelopment and expedite the review of drug candidates intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening conditions and\\nthat demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for those conditions. Under this program, FDA can, for example,\\nreview portions of a New Drug Application or BLA for a drug candidate before the entire application is complete, thus potentially\\nbeginning the review process at an earlier time.</p>\\n<p>In\\na Phase 1b clinical trial in 25 cancer patients with OM, AG013 was safe and well tolerated. Data published in the journal Cancer\\nshowed a 35% reduction of the duration of ulcerative OM in the AG013-treated patients versus the placebo-treated patients.\\nFurthermore, close to 30% of the patients treated with AG013 were full responders while all placebo-treated patients developed\\nulcerative OM. Additionally, in a Phase 1 pharmacokinetic (PK) study in 10 healthy volunteers, AG013 bacteria adhered to the buccal\\nmucosa and actively secrete protein locally, resulting in homogeneous exposure of the entire mucosal surface up to 24 hours after\\nadministration of the rinse.</p>\\n<table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\"><tr><td>2</td></tr></table>\\n<p>We\\ndeveloped a Phase 2 protocol for AG013 with the FDA under the fast track designation. In August of 2016, we received feedback\\nfrom the FDA in response to our Type C meeting and the pursuit of a Phase 2 trial on AG013 for the treatment of oral mucositis\\nin head and neck cancer patients. We filed an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) update in March 2017 and we initiated\\nthe Phase 2 study with AG013 in the United States in 2017 and in Europe in 2018. The Phase 2 trial was a double-blind, placebo-controlled,\\n2-arm, multi-center trial in which approximately 200 patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either a placebo or AG013\\nfollowing meals, beginning on the first day of chemoradiation therapy and continuing through the course of cancer treatment. The\\nstudy enrolled patients receiving chemoradiation for treatment of head and neck cancer for 7 to 9 weeks. The clinical trial was\\nconducted at clinical sites across the United States and Europe. The purpose of the Phase 2 study (NCT03234465) is to evaluate\\nthe efficacy (preventing the occurrence and shortening the duration of severe oral mucositis (“SOM”), safety and tolerability\\nof topically administered AG013 rinse compared to the placebo for reducing the incidence and severity of OM in patients undergoing\\ntraditional chemoradiation for the treatment of head and neck cancer. Key efficacy measures include collection of data regarding\\nthe duration, time to development, and overall incidence of OM (World Health Organization scale used) during the active treatment\\nphase, beginning from the start of chemoradiation therapy until 2 weeks following its completion.</p>\\n<p>On\\nDecember 2, 2019 we announced completion of enrollment in our Phase 2 clinical trial. We expect to release top line results from\\nthe trial in the first half of 2020.</p>\\n<p>An\\ninterim safety analysis was requested by the FDA on patients from our Phase 2 clinical trial of AG013 for the treatment of OM.\\nWe completed enrollment of the interim safety analysis cohort, which included 24 randomized patients in our Phase 2 clinical trial\\nof AG013 for the treatment OM. Nineteen of those patients were included in the unblinded safety evaluation, of which 10 received\\nAG013. We announced positive results from our interim safety analysis in May, 2018. The study provided information that, we believe,\\nlikely indicates that the overall incidence of severe OM is less than would be anticipated in the general head and neck cancer\\npopulation.</p>\\n<p>Safety\\nwas evaluated on the basis of treatment-emergent adverse events, vital signs, weight, physical examinations, clinical laboratory\\nassessments and the presence of AG013 in whole blood. Tolerability measures (taste, consistency and smell) were collected from\\nthe patient diaries. In addition, the reasons for study treatment discontinuation were also summarized. Following review of the\\ndata by an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), it was concluded that the clinical trial can proceed with no changes\\nto the study. The data analysis indicated that the distribution of adverse events was similar between AG013 and placebo. The serious\\nadverse events reported were consistent with those commonly reported in a head and neck cancer population receiving traditional\\nchemoradiation therapy treatments and included fevers, neutropenia, anemia, nausea and vomiting, infections and oral (mouth and\\nthroat) pain and there were no reports of AG013 related bacteremia or sepsis. Of patients that discontinued participation in the\\nclinical study, 4 patients experienced adverse events, including 3 patients who developed nausea and vomiting, 2 patients that\\nwere non-compliant with the study procedures and 3 patients developed severe OM.</p>\\n<p>The\\nDSMB met again in September 2019 and reviewed safety data on the first 100 patients who completed the trial and determined that\\nthe clinical trial could continue with no adjustments or further review.</p>\\n<p>On\\nSeptember 30, 2019, we made a poster presentation at the European Society for Medical Oncology Congress where we announced initial\\nblinded blended data from our Phase 2, placebo-controlled, clinical trial of AG013 in oral mucositis. The presentation described\\nthe methods and initial blinded results from the ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial for our lead oral mucositis product candidate,\\nAG013. The initial blinded data, submitted in the abstract, reflected the results for 42 of the 71 enrolled and randomized patients\\nacross 48 study sites who had completed their treatment course and demonstrated that in the blinded, combined placebo and active\\ntreatment groups, there was sufficient evidence of efficacy and safety to continue the study. Additional data accumulated since\\nposter submission, indicated the blinded efficacy evaluation, which included any patient with SOM after week one of treatment\\nand those receiving a cumulative dose of 55 Gy (week 6 of treatment), demonstrated an overall SOM incidence of 47%, which we believe\\nis lower than would be expected based on historical data in the head and neck cancer population receiving this chemoradiation\\nregimen. The overall rate of SOM was reported in only 13.1% (110 of 842) of evaluable visits. The overall safety profile continues\\nto be consistent with those adverse events that normally occur in cancer patients receiving chemoradiation therapy. The study,\\nhowever, remains blinded and individual treatment responses remain to be identified.</p>\\n<p><i>Our\\nAntibiotic Product Candidate-Preclinical</i></p>\\n<p>Members\\nof our scientific team discovered that a certain bacterial strain produces MU1140, a molecule belonging to the novel class of\\nantibiotics known as lantibiotics. Lantibiotics, such as MU1140, are highly modified peptide antibiotics made by a small group\\nof Gram-positive bacterial species. Approximately 60 lantibiotics have been discovered, to date. We believe lantibiotics are generally\\nrecognized by the scientific community to be potent antibiotic agents.</p>\\n<table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\"><tr><td>3</td></tr></table>\\n<p>In\\nnonclinical testing, MU1140 has shown activity against all Gram-positive bacteria against which it has been tested, including\\nthose responsible for a number of healthcare associated infections, or HAIs. A high percentage of hospital-acquired infections\\nare caused by highly resistant bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or multidrug-resistant Gram-negative\\nbacteria. We believe the need for novel antibiotics is increasing as a result of the growing resistance of target pathogens to\\nexisting FDA approved antibiotics on the market.</p>\\n<p>Lantibiotics\\nhave been difficult to investigate for their clinical usefulness as therapeutic agents in the treatment of infectious diseases\\ndue to a general inability to produce or synthesize sufficient quantities of pure amounts of these molecules. Traditional fermentation\\nmethods can only produce minute amounts of the lantibiotic.</p>\\n<p>In\\nJune 2012, we entered into the Lantibiotic Exclusive Channel Collaboration agreement (“Lantibiotic ECC”) with Intrexon\\nfor the development and commercialization of the native strain of MU1140 and related homologs using Intrexon’s advanced\\ntransgene and cell engineering platforms. Through our work with Intrexon, we have been able to produce a significant increase\\nin the fermentation titer of MU1140 compared to standard fermentation methods and have discovered a new purification process for\\nMU1140. Our work with Intrexon generated a substantial number of homologs of MU1140, and we are continuing our research and development\\nand collaboration efforts with Intrexon to develop potential derivatives of the MU1140 molecule using genetically modified bacteria.</p>\\n<p>In\\nour pre-clinical studies to support a potential IND filing with the FDA, we tested a total of six homologs of MU1140 for certain\\ncompound characteristics, including but not limited to: drug activity (based on minimum inhibitory concentration or “MIC”)\\nequal or better than “standard of care” drugs against certain drug-resistant bacteria, safety, toxicity, stability,\\nand manufacturability. An animal study specifically evaluated homolog efficacy in relation to survival, measurable amounts of\\n<i>Clostridium difficile (“C. diff”)</i> colony forming units, and toxin levels. Three homologs demonstrated promising\\nresults with one homolog, OG253 achieving a 100% survival rate throughout the entire study in contrast to an approximately 30%\\nsurvival rate for the vancomycin positive control.</p>\\n<p>Based\\non these early results, we selected a lead candidate, OG253, for which we had a pre-IND meeting with the FDA in November of 2015\\nregarding the pursuit of an IND for OG253. Following additional research and development on second generation lantibiotics, in\\nAugust of 2016, we opted to select a second generation lantibiotic, OG716, for treatment of <i>C. diff</i> as our new lead candidate.\\nOG716 is a new, orally-active homolog, that has exhibited positive results in an animal model for potential treatment of <i>C.\\ndiff</i>. Generated from our MU1140 platform, this new lantibiotic showed promising efficacy in reducing clinically relevant <i>C.\\ndiff</i> infections as measured by increased animal survival and decreased relapse as well as reduced production of toxins A &amp;\\nB and <i>C. diff</i> spores when compared to a vancomycin positive control.</p>\\n<p>The\\ntiming of the filing of an IND regarding OG716 is subject to our having sufficient available capital given all of our anticipated\\nneeds and expected requirements in connection with our ongoing research and development initiatives. We expect the IND for a first-in-human\\nclinical study of OG716 to be filed with the FDA following our completion of the requisite studies, which we commenced in October\\nof 2019.</p>\\n<p><i>Other\\nProduct Candidates and Technologies.</i></p>\\n<p>In\\naddition to our lantibiotics and oral mucositis product candidates, we also have other candidates and technologies in the oral\\ncare and weight loss areas. We do not intend to continue to develop these potential product candidates and technologies without\\npartnering with a third party. We out-licensed the continued research and development of our weight loss product candidate in\\nDecember 2013 to, LPThera LLC, and LPThera LLC continues to work to develop a product for commercial use in pets. Our oral care\\nproduct candidate SMaRT Replacement Therapy is positioned for out-licensing opportunities.</p>\\n<table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\"><tr><td>4</td></tr></table>\\n<p><strong>Corporate\\nand Other Information</strong></p>\\n<p>We\\nwere incorporated in November 1996 and commenced operations in 1999.

In June of 2016, we completed the sale of our consumer\\nprobiotics business to ProBiora Health, LLC and as a result, we will no longer generate revenue from sales of consumer probiotic\\nproducts.</p>\\n<p>As\\nof September 30, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of $123,755,548 and we have yet to achieve profitability. We incurred net\\nlosses of $11,968,726 and $7,158,521 for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and we incurred net\\nlosses of $9,914,141 and $6,731,525 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We expect to incur significant\\nand increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future as we seek to advance our product candidates through preclinical testing\\nand clinical trials to ultimately obtain regulatory approval and eventual commercialization. We will need to raise additional\\ncapital. Adequate additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. We expect that research and development\\nexpenses will increase along with general and administrative costs, as we seek to grow and continue to operate our business. There\\ncan be no assurance that additional capital will be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all.</p>\\n<p>Our\\nexecutive office is located at, 4902 Eisenhower Boulevard, Suite 125 Tampa, Florida, 33634 and our research facilities are located\\nat 13700 Progress Boulevard, Alachua, Florida 32615.

We describe global securities in greater\\ndetail below. We refer to those persons who have securities registered in their own names on the books that we or any applicable\\ntrustee, depositary or warrant agent maintain for this purpose as the “holders” of those securities. These persons\\nare the legal holders of the securities. We refer to those persons who, indirectly through others, own beneficial interests in\\nsecurities that are not registered in their own names, as “indirect holders” of those securities. As we discuss below,\\nindirect holders are not legal holders, and investors in securities issued in book-entry form or in street name will be indirect\\nholders.</p>\\n<p><strong>Book-Entry\\nHolders</strong></p>\\n<p>We\\nmay issue securities in book-entry form only, as we will specify in the applicable prospectus supplement. This means securities\\nmay be represented by one or more global securities registered in the name of a financial institution that holds them as depositary\\non behalf of other financial institutions that participate in the depositary’s book-entry system. These participating institutions,\\nwhich are referred to as participants, in turn, hold beneficial interests in the securities on behalf of themselves or their customers.</p>\\n<p>Only\\nthe person in whose name a security is registered is recognized as the holder of that security. Global securities will be registered\\nin the name of the depositary or its participants. Consequently, for global securities, we will recognize only the depositary\\nas the holder of the securities, and we will make all payments on the securities to the depositary. The depositary passes along\\nthe payments it receives to its participants, which in turn pass the payments along to their customers who are the beneficial\\nowners. The depositary and its participants do so under agreements they have made with one another or with their customers; they\\nare not obligated to do so under the terms of the securities.</p>\\n<p>As\\na result, investors in a global security will not own securities directly. Instead, they will own beneficial interests in a global\\nsecurity, through a bank, broker or other financial institution that participates in the depositary’s book-entry system\\nor holds an interest through a participant. As long as the securities are issued in global form, investors will be indirect holders,\\nand not legal holders, of the securities.</p>\\n<p><strong>Street\\nName Holders</strong></p>\\n<p>We\\nmay terminate a global security or issue securities that are not issued in global form. In these cases, investors may choose to\\nhold their securities in their own names or in “street name.” Securities held by an investor in street name would\\nbe registered in the name of a bank, broker or other financial institution that the investor chooses, and the investor would hold\\nonly a beneficial interest in those securities through an account he or she maintains at that institution.</p>\\n<p>For\\nsecurities held in street name, we or any applicable trustee or depositary will recognize only the intermediary banks, brokers\\nand other financial institutions in whose names the securities are registered as the holders of those securities, and we or any\\nsuch trustee or depositary will make all payments on those securities to them. These institutions pass along the payments they\\nreceive to their customers who are the beneficial owners, but only because they agree to do so in their customer agreements or\\nbecause they are legally required to do so. Investors who hold securities in street name will be indirect holders, not legal holders,\\nof those securities.</p>\\n<p><strong>Legal\\nHolders</strong></p>\\n<p>Our\\nobligations, as well as the obligations of any applicable trustee or third party employed by us or a trustee, run only to the\\nlegal holders of the securities. We do not have obligations to investors who hold beneficial interests in global securities, in\\nstreet name or by any other indirect means. This will be the case whether an investor chooses to be an indirect holder of a security\\nor has no choice because we are issuing the securities only in global form.</p>\\n<table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\"><tr><td>22</td></tr></table>\\n<p>For\\nexample, once we make a payment or give a notice to the holder, we have no further responsibility for the payment or notice even\\nif that holder is required, under agreements with its participants or customers or by law, to pass it along to the indirect holders\\nbut does not do so. Similarly, we may want to obtain the approval of the holders to amend an indenture, to relieve us of the consequences\\nof a default or of our obligation to comply with a particular provision of an indenture, or for other purposes. In such an event,\\nwe would seek approval only from the holders, and not the indirect holders, of the securities. Whether and how the legal holders\\ncontact the indirect holders is up to the legal holders.</p>\\n<p><strong>Special\\nConsiderations for Indirect Holders</strong></p>\\n<p>If\\nyou hold securities through a bank, broker or other financial institution, either in book-entry form because the securities are\\nrepresented by one or more global securities or in street name, you should check with your own institution to find out:</p>\\n<table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\\n<tr>\\n<td>●</td>\\n<td>how\\n    it handles securities payments and notices;</td></tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>●</td>\\n<td>whether\\n    it imposes fees or charges;</td></tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>●</td>\\n<td>how\\n    it would handle a request for the holders’ consent, if ever required;</td></tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>●</td>\\n<td>whether\\n    and how you can instruct it to send you securities registered in your own name so you can be a holder, if that is permitted\\n    in the future;</td></tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>●</td>\\n<td>how\\n    it would exercise rights under the securities if there were a default or other event triggering the need for holders to act\\n    to protect their interests; and</td></tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>●</td>\\n<td>if\\n    the securities are in book-entry form, how the depositary’s rules and procedures will affect these matters.</td></tr>\\n</table>\\n<p><strong>Global\\nSecurities</strong></p>\\n<p>A\\nglobal security is a security that represents one or any other number of individual securities held by a depositary. Generally,\\nall securities represented by the same global securities will have the same terms.</p>\\n<p>Each\\nsecurity issued in book-entry form will be represented by a global security that we issue to, deposit with and register in the\\nname of a financial institution or its nominee that we select. The financial institution that we select for this purpose is called\\nthe depositary. Unless we specify otherwise in the applicable prospectus supplement, The Depository Trust Company, New York, New\\nYork, known as DTC, will be the depositary for all securities issued in book-entry form.</p>\\n<p>A\\nglobal security may not be transferred to or registered in the name of anyone other than the depositary, its nominee or a successor\\ndepositary, unless special termination situations arise. We describe those situations below under “—Special Situations\\nWhen a Global Security Will Be Terminated.” As a result of these arrangements, the depositary, or its nominee, will be the\\nsole registered owner and legal holder of all securities represented by a global security, and investors will be permitted to\\nown only beneficial interests in a global security. Beneficial interests must be held by means of an account with a broker, bank\\nor other financial institution that in turn has an account with the depositary or with another institution that does. Thus, an\\ninvestor whose security is represented by a global security will not be a legal holder of the security, but only an indirect holder\\nof a beneficial interest in the global security.</p>\\n<p>If\\nthe prospectus supplement for a particular security indicates that the security will be issued as a global security, then the\\nsecurity will be represented by a global security at all times unless and until the global security is terminated. If termination\\noccurs, we may issue the securities through another book-entry clearing system or decide that the securities may no longer be\\nheld through any book-entry clearing system.</p>\\n<p><strong>Special\\nConsiderations for Global Securities</strong></p>\\n<p>As\\nan indirect holder, an investor’s rights relating to a global security will be governed by the account rules of the investor’s\\nfinancial institution and of the depositary, as well as general laws relating to securities transfers. We do not recognize an\\nindirect holder as a holder of securities and instead deal only with the depositary that holds the global security.</p>\\n<table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\"><tr><td>23</td></tr></table>\\n<p>If\\nsecurities are issued only as global securities, an investor should be aware of the following:</p>\\n<table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\\n<tr>\\n<td>●</td>\\n<td>an\\n    investor cannot cause the securities to be registered in his or her name, and cannot obtain non-global certificates for his\\n    or her interest in the securities, except in the special situations we describe below; </td></tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>●</td>\\n<td>an\\n    investor will be an indirect holder and must look to his or her own bank or broker for payments on the securities and protection\\n    of his or her legal rights relating to the securities, as we describe above;</td></tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>●</td>\\n<td>an\\n    investor may not be able to sell interests in the securities to some insurance companies and to other institutions that are\\n    required by law to own their securities in non-book-entry form;</td></tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>●</td>\\n<td>an\\n    investor may not be able to pledge his or her interest in the global security in circumstances where certificates representing\\n    the securities must be delivered to the lender or other beneficiary of the pledge in order for the pledge to be effective;</td></tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>●</td>\\n<td>the\\n    depositary’s policies, which may change from time to time, will govern payments, transfers, exchanges and other matters\\n    relating to an investor’s interest in the global security;</td></tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>●</td>\\n<td>we\\n    and any applicable trustee have no responsibility for any aspect of the depositary’s actions or for its records of ownership\\n    interests in the global security, nor will we or any applicable trustee supervise the depositary in any way;</td></tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>●</td>\\n<td>the\\n    depositary may, and we understand that DTC will, require that those who purchase and sell interests in the global security\\n    within its book-entry system use immediately available funds, and your broker or bank may require you to do so as well; and</td></tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>●</td>\\n<td>financial\\n    institutions that participate in the depositary’s book-entry system, and through which an investor holds its interest\\n    in the global security, may also have their own policies affecting payments, notices and other matters relating to the securities.</td></tr>\\n</table>\\n<p>There\\nmay be more than one financial intermediary in the chain of ownership for an investor. We do not monitor and are not responsible\\nfor the actions of any of those intermediaries.</p>\\n<p><strong>Special\\nSituations When a Global Security Will Be Terminated</strong></p>\\n<p>In\\na few special situations described below, a global security will terminate and interests in it will be exchanged for physical\\ncertificates representing those interests. After that exchange, the choice of whether to hold securities directly or in street\\nname will be up to the investor. Investors must consult their own banks or brokers to find out how to have their interests in\\nsecurities transferred to their own names, so that they will be direct holders. We have described the rights of holders and street\\nname investors above.</p>\\n<p>Unless\\nwe provide otherwise in the applicable prospectus supplement, a global security will terminate when the following special situations\\noccur:</p>\\n<table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\\n<tr>\\n<td>●</td>\\n<td>if\\n    the depositary notifies us that it is unwilling, unable or no longer qualified to continue as depositary for that global security\\n    and we do not appoint another institution to act as depositary within 90 days;</td></tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>●</td>\\n<td>if\\n    we notify any applicable trustee that we wish to terminate that global security; or</td></tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>●</td>\\n<td>if\\n    an event of default has occurred with regard to securities represented by that global security and has not been cured or waived.</td></tr>\\n</table>\\n<p>The\\napplicable prospectus supplement may also list additional situations for terminating a global security that would apply only to\\nthe particular series of securities covered by the prospectus supplement.
