## Update
* We already managed to generalize the functions to parse the 424B5 and 8-K filings. There are still some filings with a very different format that don't work, but we are working on it. <b> See from extracting risk factors on. </b>
* The functions to extract the stock price data are ready.
* We consolidated the training data in a single dataframe.

## Next steps
* Mock-train a BERT model to familiarize ourselves with the pre-processing tasks. 
* Define whether we are going to use a domain-specific or general purpose language corpus.
* Pre-process training data and/or language corpus.
