# Master-Thesis-Information-Management

## Update
We have run both [BERT](https://github.com/dbejarano31/Master-Thesis-Information-Management/blob/main/BERT_HF.ipynb) and [FinBERT](https://github.com/dbejarano31/Master-Thesis-Information-Management/blob/main/finBERT_HF.ipynb) on a 1350 filing dataset of 10-K, 8-K and 424B5 filings. 
<br></br>
We now are working on refining our target variable labelling approach, for more detail see the final draft. 
<br></br>
We will also start implementing the sliding window approach now that we have concretely defined the framework to be used for the models, and established the pipeline from the tokenization of the data, to the reporting of performance metrics of the models. 


## File notes
The data used for the models in the repo is [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o1BMTTU9YNPATL8x93l0N-h6sTZxLyDo/view?usp=sharing).
