# Master-Thesis-Information-Management

## Update
* We have already downloaded a bunch of filings (424B5s and 8-Ks mainly)
* We already managed to define the functions to parse all the 424B5 filings. It works, but the text contains all the html tags. So now we are working on how to clean the html - See Summary extraction section. 
* Also, we need to be able to separate each document with a blank line, since it is a requirement for BERT.
