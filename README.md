# Master-Thesis-Information-Management

## Update
* We have already downloaded a bunch of filings (424B5s and 8-Ks mainly)
* We have already defined the rules to parse the risk factors off of one 424B5 filing. Now we are working on generalizing the functions.
* The approach taken only works for the 424B5 filings, since it is based on the title headers of the risk factors section. We need to work on parsing the 8-K filings, because their headers are different.
