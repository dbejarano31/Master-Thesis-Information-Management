Any remaining net proceeds will be used for other general corporate purposes, which may include investment by the Company in its subsidiaries.Borrowings under the uncommitted credit facility bear interest at a floating rate (0.90% per annum at January 31, 2021) and are payable on demand, after specified notice by the lender. The proceeds of these borrowings were used to repay a portion of the Company’s then-existing indebtedness. DESCRIPTION OF THE SERIES 2021A SENIOR NOTESSet forth below is a description of the specific terms of the Series 2021A Senior Notes. This description supplements, and should be read together with, the description of the general terms and provisions of the senior notes set forth in the accompanying Prospectus under the caption “Description of the Senior Notes.” The following description does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, the description in the accompanying Prospectus and the Senior Note Indenture dated as of January 1, 2007, as heretofore supplemented and as further supplemented and amended from time to time (the “Senior Note Indenture”), between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (the “Senior Note Indenture Trustee”).GeneralThe Series 2021A Senior Notes will be issued as a series of senior notes under the Senior Note Indenture. The Series 2021A Senior Notes will initially be issued in the aggregate principal amount of $\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0. The Company may, at any time and without the consent of the holders of the Series 2021A Senior Notes, issue additional notes having the same ranking and the same interest rate, maturity and other terms as the Series 2021A Senior Notes (except for the public offering price and issue date and the initial interest accrual date and initial Interest Payment Date (as defined below), if applicable). Any additional notes having such similar terms, together with the Series 2021A Senior Notes, will constitute a single series of senior notes under the Senior Note Indenture.Unless earlier redeemed, the entire principal amount of the Series 2021A Senior Notes will mature and become due and payable, together with any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, on \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0,\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0. The Series 2021A Senior Notes are not subject to any sinking fund provision. The Series 2021A Senior Notes are available for purchase in denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.InterestEach Series 2021A Senior Note will bear interest at the rate of \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0% per annum (the “Securities Rate”) from the date of original issuance, payable semiannually in arrears on \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 and \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 of each year (each, an “Interest Payment Date”) to the person in whose name such Series 2021A Senior Note is registered at the close of business on the fifteenth calendar day prior to such Interest Payment Date (whether or not a Business Day). The initial Interest Payment Date is \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0, 2021. The amount of interest payable will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. In the event that any date on which interest is payable on the Series 2021A Senior Notes is not a Business Day, then payment of the interest payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day which is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay), with the same force and effect as if made on such date. “Business Day” means a day other than (i) a Saturday or Sunday, (ii) a day on which banks in New York, New York are authorized or obligated by law or executive order to remain closed or (iii) a day on which the Senior Note Indenture Trustee’s corporate trust office is closed for business.RankingThe Series 2021A Senior Notes will be direct, unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Company ranking equally with all other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Company from time to time outstanding. Since the Company is a holding company, the right of the Company and, hence, the right of creditors of the Company (including holders of the Series 2021A Senior Notes) to participate in any distribution of the assets of any subsidiary of the Company, whether upon liquidation, reorganization or otherwise, is structurally subordinated to claims of creditors and preferred stockholders of each subsidiary. As of December 31, 2020, on a consolidated basis, the Company had approximately $48.5 billion of outstanding long-term debt (including securities due within one year), of which approximately $33.5 billion was long-term debt (including securities due within one year) of the Company’s subsidiaries. In addition, the Company had approximately $0.6 billion of short-term notes payable, all of which was short-term notes payable of the Company’s subsidiaries. In addition, as of December 31, 2020, the Company’s subsidiaries had approximately $0.3\\xa0billion of preferred stock outstanding. The Series 2021A Senior Notes will be effectively subordinated to all secured indebtedness of the Company. The Company had no secured debt outstanding at December 31, 2020. The Senior Note Indenture contains no restrictions on the amount of additional indebtedness that may be incurred by the Company or its subsidiaries.Optional RedemptionAt any time and from time to time prior to \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0, \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 (the “Par Call Date”), the Series 2021A Senior Notes will be subject to redemption at the option of the Company in whole or in part upon not less than 15 nor more than 60 days’ notice, at redemption prices equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Series 2021A Senior Notes being redeemed and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal of and interest on the Series 2021A Senior Notes being redeemed (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued to the redemption date) from the redemption date to the Par Call Date discounted (for purposes of determining present value) to the redemption date on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at a discount rate equal to the Treasury Yield (as defined below) plus \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 basis points, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest on the Series 2021A Senior Notes being redeemed to the redemption date. At any time and from time to time on or after the Par Call Date, the Series 2021A Senior Notes will be subject to redemption at the option of the Company in whole or in part upon not less than 15 nor more than 60 days’ notice, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Series 2021A Senior Notes being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Series 2021A Senior Notes being redeemed to the redemption date.Any redemption of the Series 2021A Senior Notes may be conditioned upon the occurrence of one or more conditions precedent.“Treasury Yield” means, with respect to any redemption date, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such redemption date.“Comparable Treasury Issue” means the United States Treasury security selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Series 2021A Senior Notes to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of the Series 2021A Senior Notes.“Comparable Treasury Price” means, with respect to any redemption date, (i) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such redemption date, after excluding the highest and lowest of such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations or (ii) if the Company obtains fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations.“Independent Investment Banker” means an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Company.“Reference Treasury Dealer” means a primary United States Government securities dealer in the United States appointed by the Company.“Reference Treasury Dealer Quotation” means, with respect to a Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption date, the average, as determined by the Company, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount and quoted in writing to the Company by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m. Eastern time on the third Business Day in New York City preceding such redemption date).If notice of redemption is given as aforesaid, the Series 2021A Senior Notes to be redeemed will, on the redemption date (subject, in the case of a conditional redemption, to the satisfaction of all conditions precedent), become due and payable at the applicable redemption price described above together with any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, and from and after such date (unless the Company has defaulted in the payment of such redemption price and accrued interest) such Series 2021A Senior Notes shall cease to bear interest. If any Series 2021A Senior Note called for redemption shall not be paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, the principal shall, until paid, bear interest from the redemption date at the Securities Rate. See “Description of the Senior Notes — Events of Default” in the accompanying Prospectus.Subject to the foregoing and to applicable law (including, without limitation, United States federal securities laws), the Company or its affiliates may, at any time and from time to time, purchase outstanding Series 2021A Senior Notes by tender, in the open market or by private agreement.Information Concerning the Senior Note Indenture TrusteeAn affiliate of the Senior Note Indenture Trustee, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, is acting as an underwriter and a representative of the underwriters in this offering.Book-Entry Only Issuance—The Depository Trust CompanyThe Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) will act as the initial securities depository for the Series 2021A Senior Notes. The Series\\xa02021A Senior Notes offered hereby will be issued only as fully-registered securities registered in the name of Cede\\xa0 Co., DTC’s nominee, or such other name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. One or more fully-registered global Series\\xa02021A Senior Notes certificates will be issued, representing in the aggregate the total principal amount of Series\\xa02021A Senior Notes, and will be deposited with the Senior Note Indenture Trustee on behalf of DTC.  Investors may hold interests in the Series 2021A Senior Notes offered hereby through DTC if they are participants in DTC or indirectly through organizations that are participants in DTC, including Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V., as operator of the Euroclear system, or Clearstream Banking, société anonyme, Luxembourg (“Clearstream”).DTC is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section\\xa017A of the 1934 Act. DTC holds and provides asset servicing for over 3.5\\xa0million issues of United States and non-United States equity issues, corporate and municipal debt issues and money market instruments (from over 100 countries) that DTC’s participants (“Direct Participants”) deposit with DTC. DTC also facilitates the post-trade settlement among Direct Participants of sales and other securities transactions in deposited securities, through electronic computerized book-entry transfers and pledges between Direct Participants’ accounts. This eliminates the need for physical movement of securities certificates. Direct Participants include both United States and non-United States securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. DTC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Depository Trust\\xa0 Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”). DTCC is the holding company for DTC, National Securities Clearing Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, all of which are registered clearing agencies. DTCC is owned by the users of its regulated subsidiaries. Access to the DTC system is also available to others such as both United States and non-United States securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Direct Participant, either directly or indirectly (“Indirect Participants”). The DTC rules applicable to its Direct and Indirect Participants are on file with the SEC. More information about DTC can be found at www.dtcc.com. The contents of such website do not constitute part of this Prospectus Supplement.Purchases of Series\\xa02021A Senior Notes under the DTC system must be made by or through Direct Participants, which will receive a credit for the Series 2021A Senior Notes on DTC’s records. The ownership interest of each actual purchaser of each Series 2021A Senior Note (“Beneficial Owner”) is in turn to be recorded on the Direct and Indirect Participants’ records. Beneficial Owners will not receive written confirmation from DTC of their purchases. Beneficial Owners, however, are expected to receive written confirmations providing details of the transactions, as well as periodic statements of their holdings, from the Direct or Indirect Participants through which the Beneficial Owners purchased Series\\xa02021A Senior Notes. Transfers of ownership interests in the Series\\xa02021A Senior Notes are to be accomplished by entries made on the books of Direct and Indirect Participants acting on behalf of Beneficial Owners. Beneficial Owners will not receive certificates representing their ownership interests in Series\\xa02021A Senior Notes, except in the event that use of the book-entry system for the Series\\xa02021A Senior Notes is discontinued.To facilitate subsequent transfers, all Series\\xa02021A Senior Notes deposited by Direct Participants with DTC are registered in the name of DTC’s nominee, Cede\\xa0 Co., or such other name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. The deposit of Series\\xa02021A Senior Notes with DTC and their registration in the name of Cede\\xa0 Co. or such other DTC nominee do not effect any changes in beneficial ownership. DTC has no knowledge of the actual Beneficial Owners of the Series\\xa02021A Senior Notes. DTC’s records reflect only the identity of the Direct Participants to whose accounts such Series\\xa02021A Senior Notes are credited, which may or may not be the Beneficial Owners. The Direct and Indirect Participants will remain responsible for keeping account of their holdings on behalf of their customers.Conveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to Direct Participants, by Direct Participants to Indirect Participants, and by Direct Participants and Indirect Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by arrangements among them, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time.Redemption notices will be sent to DTC. If less than all of the Series 2021A Senior Notes are being redeemed, DTC’s practice is to determine by lot the amount of interest of each Direct Participant in such Series 2021A Senior Notes to be redeemed.Although voting with respect to the Series\\xa02021A Senior Notes is limited, in those cases where a vote is required, neither DTC nor Cede\\xa0 Co. (nor any other DTC nominee) will consent or vote with respect to the Series\\xa02021A Senior Notes unless authorized by a Direct Participant in accordance with DTC’s procedures. Under its usual procedures, DTC mails an Omnibus Proxy to the Company as soon as possible after the record date. The Omnibus Proxy assigns Cede\\xa0 Co.’s consenting or voting rights to those Direct Participants to whose accounts the Series\\xa02021A Senior Notes are credited on the record date (identified in a listing attached to the Omnibus Proxy).Payments on the Series\\xa02021A Senior Notes will be made to Cede\\xa0 Co., or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. DTC’s practice is to credit Direct Participants’ accounts upon DTC’s receipt of funds and corresponding detail information from the Company or the Senior Note Indenture Trustee on the relevant payment date in accordance with their respective holdings shown on DTC’s records. Payments by Direct or Indirect Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is the case with securities held for the account of customers registered in “street name,” and will be the responsibility of such Direct or Indirect Participant and not of DTC or the Company, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time. Payment to Cede\\xa0 Co. (or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC) is the responsibility of the Company, disbursement of such payments to Direct Participants is the responsibility of DTC, and disbursement of such payments to the Beneficial Owners is the responsibility of Direct and Indirect Participants.Except as provided herein, a Beneficial Owner of a global Series\\xa02021A Senior Note will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of Series\\xa02021A Senior Notes. Accordingly, each Beneficial Owner must rely on the procedures of DTC to exercise any rights under the Series\\xa02021A Senior Notes. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Such laws may impair the ability to transfer beneficial interests in a global Series\\xa02021A Senior Note.DTC may discontinue providing its services as securities depository with respect to the Series\\xa02021A Senior Notes at any time by giving reasonable notice to the Company. Under such circumstances, in the event that a successor securities depository is not obtained, Series\\xa02021A Senior Notes certificates will be required to be printed and delivered to the holders of record. Additionally, the Company may decide to discontinue use of the system of book-entry transfers through DTC (or a successor securities depository) with respect to the Series\\xa02021A Senior Notes. The Company understands, however, that under current industry practices, DTC would notify its Direct and Indirect Participants of the Company’s decision, but will only withdraw beneficial interests from a global Series\\xa02021A Senior Note at the request of each Direct or Indirect Participant. In that event, certificates for the Series 2021A Senior Notes will be printed and delivered to the applicable Direct or Indirect Participant.The information in this section concerning DTC and DTC’s book-entry system has been obtained from sources that the Company believes to be reliable, but neither the Company nor any underwriter takes any responsibility for the accuracy thereof. Neither the Company nor any underwriter has any responsibility for the performance by DTC or its Direct or Indirect Participants of their respective obligations as described herein or under the rules and procedures governing their respective operations.Global Clearance and Settlement ProceduresSecondary market trading between Clearstream participants and/or Euroclear system participants will occur in the ordinary way in accordance with the applicable rules and operating procedures of Clearstream and the Euroclear system, as applicable.Cross-market transfers between persons holding directly or indirectly through DTC on the one hand, and directly or indirectly through Clearstream participants or Euroclear system participants on the other, will be effected through DTC in accordance with DTC rules on behalf of the relevant European international clearing system by its United States depositary; however, such cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions to the relevant European international clearing system by the counterparty in such system in accordance with its rules and procedures and within its established deadlines (European time). The relevant European international clearing system will, if the transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to its United States depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving securities in DTC, and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day funds settlement applicable to DTC.  Clearstream participants and Euroclear system participants may not deliver instructions directly to their respective United States depositaries.Because of time-zone differences, credits of Series 2021A Senior Notes received in Clearstream or the Euroclear system as a result of a transaction with a DTC participant will be made during subsequent securities settlement processing and dated the business day following the DTC settlement date. Such credits or any transactions in such Series 2021A Senior Notes settled during such processing will be reported to the relevant Clearstream participant or Euroclear system participant on such business day. Cash received in Clearstream or the Euroclear system as a result of sales of the Series 2021A Senior Notes by or through a Clearstream participant or a Euroclear system participant to a DTC participant will be received with value on the DTC settlement date but will be available in the relevant Clearstream or the Euroclear system cash account only as of the business day following settlement in DTC.CERTAIN UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS FOR NON-UNITED STATES HOLDERSThe following summary describes certain United States federal income tax considerations relevant to the acquisition, ownership and disposition of the Series 2021A Senior Notes, and insofar as it relates to matters of United States federal income tax laws and regulations or legal conclusions with respect thereto, constitutes the opinion of the Company’s tax counsel, Troutman Pepper Hamilton Sanders LLP. The following discussion does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential United States federal income tax considerations. This discussion only applies to Series 2021A Senior Notes that are held as capital assets, within the meaning of Section\\xa01221 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and that are purchased in the initial offering at the initial offering price, by Non-United States Holders (as defined below). This summary is based on the Code, administrative pronouncements, judicial decisions and regulations of the Treasury Department, changes to any of which subsequent to the date of this Prospectus Supplement may affect the tax consequences described herein. This discussion does not describe all of the United States federal income tax considerations that may be relevant to Non-United States Holders in light of their particular circumstances or to Non-United States Holders subject to special rules, such as certain financial institutions, tax-exempt organizations, insurance companies, “controlled foreign corporations,” “passive foreign investment companies,” partnerships or other pass-through entities for United States federal income tax purposes, traders or dealers in securities or commodities, persons holding Series 2021A Senior Notes as part of a hedge or other integrated transaction, certain former citizens or residents of the United States or foreign persons eligible for benefits under an applicable income tax treaty with the United States. The Company has not and will not seek any rulings or opinions from the Internal Revenue Service (the\\xa0“IRS”) with respect to the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not take a different position concerning the tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership or disposition of the Series 2021A Senior Notes or that any such position would not be sustained.For purposes of this summary, a “Non-United States Holder” means a beneficial owner of a Series 2021A Senior Note (other than a partnership, or other entity or arrangement treated as a partnership) that, for United States federal income tax purposes, is not (i)\\xa0an individual that is a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii)\\xa0a corporation or other entity treated as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes that is created or organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; (iii)\\xa0an estate the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source; or (iv)\\xa0a trust if (A)\\xa0a court within the United States is able to exercise primary control over its administration and one or more United States persons, within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code (a “United States Person”), have the authority to control all substantial decisions of such trust, or (B)\\xa0the trust has made an election under the applicable Treasury regulations to be treated as a United States Person. If a partnership, or other entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes, beneficially owns the Series 2021A Senior Notes, the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Partners in a partnership that beneficially own the Series 2021A Senior Notes should consult their tax advisors as to the particular United States\\xa0federal income tax considerations relevant to the acquisition, ownership and disposition of the Series 2021A Senior Notes applicable to them.InterestIt is anticipated, and this discussion assumes, that the Series 2021A Senior Notes will not be issued with more than a de minimis amount of original issue discount. Except if interest on the Series 2021A Senior Notes is effectively connected with the conduct by a Non-United States Holder of a trade or business within the United States, and subject to the potential back-up withholding and Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (“FATCA”) withholding summarized below, a Non-United States Holder generally will not be subject to United States federal income or withholding tax on payments of interest on the Series 2021A Senior Notes provided that such Non-United States Holder (A)\\xa0does not directly or indirectly, actually or constructively, own 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of the Company’s stock entitled to vote, (B)\\xa0is not a controlled foreign corporation that is related to the Company directly or constructively through stock ownership, (C) is not a bank receiving such interest on an extension of credit made pursuant to a loan agreement entered into in the ordinary course of its trade or business, and (D)\\xa0satisfies certain certification requirements. Such certification requirements will be met if (x) the Non-United States Holder provides its name and address, and certifies on an IRS\\xa0Form\\xa0W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or a substantially similar form), under penalties of perjury, that it is not a United States Person or (y)\\xa0a securities clearing organization or certain other financial institutions holding the Series 2021A Senior Notes on behalf of the Non-United States Holder certifies on IRS Form\\xa0W-8IMY, under penalties of perjury, that such certification has been received by it and furnishes the Company or its paying agent with a copy thereof. In addition, the Company or its paying agent must not have actual knowledge or reason to know that the beneficial owner of the Series 2021A Senior Notes is a United States Person.If interest on the Series 2021A Senior Notes is not effectively connected with the conduct by the Non-United States Holder of a trade or business within the United States, but such Non-United States Holder does not satisfy the other requirements outlined in the preceding paragraph, interest on the Series 2021A Senior Notes generally will be subject to United States withholding tax at a 30% rate (or a lower applicable treaty rate).If interest on the Series 2021A Senior Notes is effectively connected with the conduct by a Non-United States Holder of a trade or business within the United States, and, if certain tax treaties apply, is attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed base within the United States, the Non-United States Holder generally will be subject to United States federal income tax on a net income basis at the rate applicable to United States Persons generally (and, with respect to corporate Non-United States Holders, may also be subject to a 30% branch profits tax (or\\xa0a lower applicable treaty branch profits tax rate)). If interest is effectively connected with the conduct by a Non-United States Holder of a trade or business within the United States, such interest payments will not be subject to United States withholding tax if the Non-United States Holder provides the Company or its paying agent with the appropriate documentation (generally an IRS Form\\xa0W-8ECI).Sale or Other Taxable Disposition of the Series 2021A Senior NotesSubject to the backup withholding summary below, a Non-United States Holder generally will not be subject to United States federal withholding tax with respect to gain, if any, recognized on the sale or other taxable disposition of the Series 2021A Senior Notes. A Non-United States Holder will also generally not be subject to United States federal income tax with respect to such gain, unless (i)\\xa0the gain is effectively connected with the conduct by such Non-United States Holder of a trade or business within the United States, and, if certain tax treaties apply, is attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed base within the United States, or (ii)\\xa0in the case of a Non-United States Holder that is a nonresident alien individual, such Non-United States Holder is present in the United States for 183 or more days in the taxable year of the disposition and certain other conditions are satisfied. In the case described in (i)\\xa0above, gain or loss recognized on the disposition of such Series 2021A Senior Notes generally will be subject to United States federal income taxation in the same manner as if such gain or loss were recognized by a United States Person, and, in the case of a Non-United States Holder that is a foreign corporation, may also be subject to the branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower applicable treaty branch profits tax rate). In the case described in (ii)\\xa0above, the Non-United States Holder will be subject to a 30% tax (or lower applicable treaty rate) on any capital gain recognized on the disposition of the Series 2021A Senior Notes (after being offset by certain United States source capital losses).Information Reporting and Backup WithholdingInformation returns will be filed annually with the IRS in connection with the Company’s payment of interest on the Series 2021A Senior Notes. Copies of these information returns may also be made available under the provisions of a specific tax treaty or other agreement to the tax authorities of the country in which the Non-United States Holder resides. Unless the Non-United States Holder complies with certification procedures to establish that it is not a United States Person, information returns may be filed with the IRS in connection with the proceeds from a sale or other disposition of the Series 2021A Senior Notes, and the Non-United States Holder may be subject to backup withholding tax (currently at a rate of 24%) on payments of interest on the Series 2021A Senior Notes or on the proceeds from a sale or other disposition of the Series 2021A Senior Notes. The certification procedures required to claim the exemption from withholding tax on interest described above will satisfy the certification requirements necessary to avoid the backup withholding tax as well. The amount of any backup withholding from a payment to a Non-United States Holder may be allowed as a credit against the Non-United States Holder’s United States federal income tax liability or may entitle the Non-United States Holder to a refund, provided that the required information is furnished to the IRS in a timely manner.Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act WithholdingUnder FATCA and additional guidance issued by the IRS, a United States federal withholding tax of 30% generally will apply to interest on a debt obligation paid to (i) a foreign financial institution (as a beneficial owner or as an intermediary), unless such institution enters into an agreement with the United States government to collect and provide to the United States tax authorities substantial information regarding United States account holders of such institution (which would include certain equity and debt holders of such institution, as well as certain account holders that are foreign entities with United States owners), or (ii) a foreign entity that is not a financial institution (as a beneficial owner or as an intermediary), unless such entity provides the withholding agent with a certification identifying the substantial United States owners of the entity, which generally includes any United States Person who directly or indirectly owns more than 10% of the entity. Certain Non-United States Holders located in a jurisdiction with an intergovernmental agreement with the United States governing FATCA may be subject to different rules. The Company will not be obligated to pay any additional amounts to “gross up” payments to holders as a result of any withholding or deduction for such taxes. Non-United States Holders are encouraged to consult with their tax advisors regarding the possible implications of the FATCA withholding rules on their investment in the Series 2021A Senior Notes.Persons considering the purchase of Series 2021A Senior Notes are urged to consult their tax advisors with regard to the application of the United States federal income tax laws to their particular situations as well as any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction. Furthermore, this discussion does not describe the effect of United States federal estate and gift tax laws, the potential application of the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income or the effect of any applicable foreign, state or local law.UNDERWRITING (CONFLICTS OF INTEREST)Subject to the terms and conditions of an underwriting agreement (the “Underwriting Agreement”), the Company has agreed to sell to each of the underwriters named below (the “Underwriters”) for whom Morgan Stanley  Co. LLC, Scotia Capital (USA) Inc., Truist Securities, Inc., U.S. Bancorp Investments, Inc. and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC are acting as representatives (the “Representatives”) and each of the Underwriters has severally, and not jointly, agreed to purchase from the Company the principal amount of the Series 2021A Senior Notes set forth opposite its name below:UnderwritersPrincipal Amount of Series 2021ASenior NotesMorgan Stanley  Co.

Cabrera Capital Markets LLC CastleOak Securities, L.P.Drexel Hamilton, LLCSiebert Williams Shank  Co., LLCTotal$The Underwriting Agreement provides that the obligations of the several Underwriters to pay for and accept delivery of the Series 2021A Senior Notes are subject to, among other things, the approval of certain legal matters by their counsel and certain other conditions. In the Underwriting Agreement, the Underwriters have severally agreed, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, to purchase all of the Series 2021A Senior Notes offered hereby, if any of the Series 2021A Senior Notes are purchased. The offering of the Series 2021A Senior Notes by the Underwriters is subject to receipt and acceptance of the Series 2021A Senior Notes and subject to the Underwriters’ right to reject any order in whole or in part.The Underwriters propose to offer the Series 2021A Senior Notes to the public at the initial public offering price set forth on the cover page of this Prospectus Supplement and may offer the Series 2021A Senior Notes to certain dealers at such price less a concession not in excess of \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0% of the principal amount per Series 2021A Senior Note. The Underwriters may allow, and such dealers may reallow, a concession not in excess of \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0% of the principal amount per Series 2021A Senior Note. After the initial public offering, the initial public offering price and other selling terms may be changed.The Series 2021A Senior Notes are a new issue of securities with no established trading market. The Series 2021A Senior Notes will not be listed on any securities exchange or on any automated dealer quotation system. The Underwriters may make a market in the Series 2021A Senior Notes after completion of the offering, but will not be obligated to do so and may discontinue any market-making activities at any time without notice. No assurance can be given as to the liquidity of the trading market for the Series 2021A Senior Notes or that an active public market for the Series 2021A Senior Notes will develop. If an active public trading market for the Series 2021A Senior Notes does not develop, the market price and liquidity of the Series 2021A Senior Notes may be adversely affected.The Company has agreed to indemnify the several Underwriters against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.The Company’s expenses associated with the offer and sale of the Series 2021A Senior Notes (not including the underwriting discount) are estimated to be $\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0.The Company has agreed with the Underwriters that, during the period of 15 days from the date of the Underwriting Agreement, it will not sell, offer to sell, grant any option for the sale of, or otherwise dispose of any Series 2021A Senior Notes, any security convertible into, exchangeable into or exercisable for the Series 2021A Senior Notes or any debt securities substantially similar to the Series 2021A Senior Notes (except for the Series\\xa02021A Senior Notes issued pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement and the proposed Series 2021B Senior Notes), without the prior written consent of the Representatives. This agreement does not apply to issuances of commercial paper or other debt securities with scheduled maturities of less than one year.In order to facilitate the offering of the Series 2021A Senior Notes, the Underwriters may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Series 2021A Senior Notes. Specifically, the Underwriters may over-allot in connection with this offering, creating short positions in the Series 2021A Senior Notes for their own accounts. In addition, to cover over-allotments or to stabilize the price of the Series 2021A Senior Notes, the Underwriters may bid for, and purchase, Series 2021A Senior Notes in the open market. Finally, the Underwriters may reclaim selling concessions allowed to the Underwriters or dealers for distributing Series 2021A Senior Notes in this offering, if the Underwriters repurchase previously distributed Series 2021A Senior Notes in transactions to cover short positions, in stabilization transactions or otherwise. Any of these activities may stabilize or maintain the market price of the Series 2021A Senior Notes above independent market levels. The Underwriters are not required to engage in these activities and may end any of these activities at any time without notice.In general, purchases of a security for the purpose of stabilization or to reduce a short position could cause the price of the security to be higher than it might be in the absence of such purchases. The imposition of a penalty bid might also have an effect on the price of a security to the extent that it were to discourage resales of the security.Neither the Company nor any Underwriter makes any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the Series 2021A Senior Notes. In addition, neither the Company nor any Underwriter makes any representation that the Underwriters will engage in such transactions or that such transactions once commenced will not be discontinued without notice.It is expected that delivery of the Series 2021A Senior Notes will be made, against payment for the Series 2021A Senior Notes, on or about February\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0, 2021, which will be the \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0business day following the pricing of the Series 2021A Senior Notes. Under Rule 15c6-1 under the 1934 Act, purchases or sales of securities in the secondary market generally are required to settle within two business days (T+2), unless the parties to any such transactions expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers of the Series 2021A Senior Notes who wish to trade the Series 2021A Senior Notes on the date of this Prospectus Supplement or the next succeeding \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 business day(s) will be required, because the Series 2021A Senior Notes will settle within business days (T+\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0), to specify an alternate settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Series 2021A Senior Notes who wish to trade on the date of this Prospectus Supplement or the next succeeding \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0business day(s) should consult their own legal advisors.In the ordinary course of business, the Underwriters and their respective affiliates have from time to time performed and may in the future perform various financial advisory, commercial banking, investment banking, sales and trading, investment research, principal investment, hedging, market making, asset leasing, treasury services and other financial and non-financial activities and services for the Company and its affiliates, for which they received or will receive customary compensation.In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the Underwriters and their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities), loans, commodities, currencies, credit default swaps and other financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own accounts and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the Company or its affiliates. Certain of the Underwriters or their affiliates that have a lending relationship with the Company routinely hedge, and certain other of the Underwriters or their affiliates may hedge, their credit exposure to the Company consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, such Underwriters and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in the Company’s securities, including potentially the Series 2021A Senior Notes. Any such credit default swaps or short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Series 2021A Senior Notes. The Underwriters and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.A. is not a United States registered broker-dealer and it will not effect any offers or sales of any Series 2021A Senior Notes in the United States unless it is through one or more United States registered broker-dealers as permitted by the regulations of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”).Siebert Williams Shank  Co., LLC has entered into a referral agreement with Northern Trust Securities, Inc., a FINRA member and subsidiary of Northern Trust Corporation, pursuant to which it will pay a referral fee to Northern Trust Securities, Inc. in connection with this offering.Conflicts of InterestCertain of the Underwriters or their affiliates hold a portion of the indebtedness that the Company intends to repay using all or a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of the Series 2021A Senior Notes. It is possible that one or more of the Underwriters or their affiliates could receive 5% or more of the net proceeds from the sale of the Series 2021A Senior Notes, and, in that case, such Underwriter would be deemed to have a “conflict of interest” within the meaning of FINRA Rule 5121. In the event of any such conflict of interest, such Underwriter would be required to conduct the distribution of the Series 2021A Senior Notes in accordance with FINRA Rule 5121. If the distribution is conducted in accordance with FINRA Rule 5121, such Underwriter would not be permitted to confirm a sale of a Series 2021A Senior Note in this offering to an account over which it exercises discretionary authority without the prior specific written approval of the account holder.Selling RestrictionsCanadaEach Underwriter has represented and agreed that the Series 2021A Senior Notes may be sold in Canada only to purchasers purchasing, or deemed to be purchasing, as principal that are accredited investors, as defined in National Instrument 45-106 Prospectus Exemptions or subsection 73.3(1) of the Securities Act (Ontario), and are permitted clients, as defined in National Instrument 31-103 Registration Requirements, Exemptions and Ongoing Registrant Obligations. Any resale of the Series 2021A Senior Notes must be made in accordance with an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the prospectus requirements of applicable Canadian securities laws.Securities legislation in certain provinces or territories of Canada may provide a purchaser with remedies for rescission or damages if this Prospectus Supplement or the accompanying Prospectus (including any amendment thereto) contains a misrepresentation, provided that the remedies for rescission or damages are exercised by the purchaser within the time limit prescribed by the securities legislation of the purchaser’s province or territory. The purchaser should refer to any applicable provisions of the securities legislation of the purchaser’s province or territory for particulars of these rights or consult with a legal advisor.Pursuant to section 3A.3 of National Instrument 33-105 Underwriting Conflicts (“NI 33-105”), the Underwriters are not required to comply with the disclosure requirements of NI 33-105 regarding underwriter conflicts of interest in connection with this offering.European Economic AreaThe Series 2021A Senior Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (the “EEA”). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 as amended where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended, the “Prospectus Regulation”).

Subject to the prior payment of all Senior Indebtedness, the rights of the holders of the Junior Subordinated Notes will be subrogated to the rights of the holders of Senior Indebtedness to receive payments and distributions applicable to such Senior Indebtedness until all amounts owing on the Junior Subordinated Notes are paid in full.The term “Senior Indebtedness” means, with respect to the Company, (i)\\xa0any payment due in respect of indebtedness of the Company, whether outstanding at the date of execution of the Subordinated Note Indenture or incurred, created or assumed after such date, (a)\\xa0in respect of money borrowed (including any financial derivative, hedging or futures contract or similar instrument) and (b)\\xa0evidenced by securities, debentures, bonds, notes or other similar instruments issued by the Company that, by their terms, are senior or senior subordinated debt securities including, without limitation, all such obligations under its indentures with various trustees; (ii)\\xa0all capital lease obligations; (iii)\\xa0all obligations issued or assumed as the deferred purchase price of property, all conditional sale obligations and all obligations of the Company under any title retention agreement (but excluding trade accounts payable arising in the ordinary course of business and long-term purchase obligations); (iv)\\xa0all obligations for the reimbursement of any letter of credit, banker’s acceptance, security purchase facility or similar credit transaction; (v)\\xa0all obligations of the type referred to in clauses\\xa0(i) through (iv)\\xa0above of other persons the payment of which the Company is responsible or liable as obligor, guarantor or otherwise; and (vi)\\xa0all obligations of the type referred to in clauses\\xa0(i) through (v)\\xa0above of other persons secured by any lien on any property or asset of the Company (whether or not such obligation is assumed by the Company), except for (1)\\xa0any such indebtedness that is by its terms subordinated to or that ranks equally with the Junior Subordinated Notes and (2)\\xa0any unsecured indebtedness between or among the Company or its affiliates. Such Senior Indebtedness shall continue to be Senior Indebtedness and be entitled to the benefits of the subordination provisions contained in the Subordinated Note Indenture irrespective of any amendment, modification or waiver of any term of such Senior Indebtedness.The Subordinated Note Indenture does not limit the aggregate amount of Senior Indebtedness that may be issued by the Company. As of December\\xa031, 2020, the Senior Indebtedness of the Company, on an unconsolidated basis, aggregated approximately $8.0 billion. Since the Company is a holding company, the right of the Company and, hence, the right of creditors of the Company (including holders of Senior Notes and Junior Subordinated Notes) to participate in any distribution of the assets of any subsidiary of the Company, whether upon liquidation, reorganization or otherwise, is subject to prior claims of creditors and preferred stockholders of each subsidiary. As of December\\xa031, 2020, on a consolidated basis, the Company had approximately $48.5 billion of outstanding long-term debt (including securities due within one year), of which approximately $33.5 billion was long-term debt (including securities due within one year) of the Company’s subsidiaries. In addition, the Company had approximately $0.6 billion of short-term notes payable, all of which was short-term notes payable of the Company’s subsidiaries. In addition, as of December 31, 2020, the Company’s subsidiaries had approximately $0.3 billion of preferred stock outstanding.Additional Interest“Additional Interest” is defined in the Subordinated Note Indenture as\\xa0any interest due and not paid on an interest payment date, together with interest on such interest due from such interest payment date to the date of payment, compounded quarterly, on each interest payment date.Certain CovenantsThe Company covenants in the Subordinated Note Indenture, for the benefit of the holders of each series of Junior Subordinated Notes, that, (i) if at such time the Company shall have given notice of its election to extend an interest payment period for such series of Junior Subordinated Notes and such extension shall be continuing, or (ii) if at such time an Event of Default under the Subordinated Note Indenture with respect to such series of Junior Subordinated Notes shall have occurred and be continuing, (a)\\xa0the Company shall not declare or pay any dividend or make any distributions with respect to, or redeem, purchase, acquire or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any of its capital stock and (b)\\xa0the Company shall not make any payment of interest on, principal of or premium, if any, on or repay, repurchase or redeem any debt securities (including guarantees) issued by the Company which rank equally with or junior to the Junior Subordinated Notes. None of the foregoing, however, shall restrict (i)\\xa0any of the actions described in the preceding sentence resulting from any reclassification of the Company’s capital stock or the exchange or conversion of one class or series of the Company’s capital stock for another class or series of the Company’s capital stock, (ii)\\xa0the purchase of fractional interests in shares of the Company’s capital stock pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions of such capital stock or the security being converted or exchanged, (iii)\\xa0dividends, payments or distributions payable in shares of capital stock, (iv)\\xa0redemptions, purchases or other acquisitions of shares of capital stock in connection with any employment contract, incentive plan, benefit plan or other similar arrangement of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or in connection with a dividend reinvestment or stock purchase plan, or (v)\\xa0any declaration of a dividend in connection with implementation of any stockholders’ rights plan, or the issuance of rights, stock or other property under any such plan, or the redemption, repurchase or other acquisition of any such rights pursuant thereto.Events of DefaultUnless provided otherwise in the supplemental indenture relating to any series, the Subordinated Note Indenture provides that any one or more of the following described events with respect to the Junior Subordinated Notes of any series, which has occurred and is continuing, constitutes an “Event of Default” with respect to the Junior Subordinated Notes of such series:(a)\\xa0failure for 30\\xa0days to pay interest on the Junior Subordinated Notes of such series, including any Additional Interest in respect of the Junior Subordinated Notes of such series, when due on an interest payment date other than at maturity or upon earlier redemption; provided, however, that a valid extension of the interest payment period by the Company shall not constitute a default in the payment of interest for this purpose; or(b)\\xa0failure to pay principal of, or premium, if any, on or interest, including Additional Interest, on the Junior Subordinated Notes of such series when due at maturity or upon earlier redemption; or(c)\\xa0failure for three Business Days to deposit any sinking fund payment when due by the terms of a Junior Subordinated Note of such series; or(d)\\xa0failure to observe or perform any other covenant or warranty of the Company in the Subordinated Note Indenture (other than a covenant or warranty which has expressly been included in the Subordinated Note Indenture solely for the benefit of one or more series of Junior Subordinated Notes other than such series) for 90\\xa0days after written notice to the Company from the Subordinated Note Indenture Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Junior Subordinated Notes of such series; or(e)\\xa0certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company.The holders of not less than a majority in aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Junior Subordinated Notes of any series have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Subordinated Note Indenture Trustee with respect to the Junior Subordinated Notes of such series. If a Subordinated Note Indenture Event of Default occurs and is continuing with respect to the Junior Subordinated Notes of any series, then the Subordinated Note Indenture Trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Junior Subordinated Notes of such series may declare the principal amount of the Junior Subordinated Notes due and payable immediately by notice in writing to the Company (and to the Subordinated Note Indenture Trustee if given by the holders), and upon any such declaration such principal amount shall become immediately due and payable. At any time after such a declaration of acceleration with respect to the Junior Subordinated Notes of any series has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained as provided in Article Five of the Subordinated Note Indenture, the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Junior Subordinated Notes of such series may, by written notice to the Company and the Subordinated Note Indenture Trustee, rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if the default has been cured or waived and the Company has paid or deposited with the Subordinated Note Indenture Trustee a sum sufficient to pay all matured installments of interest (including any Additional Interest) and principal due otherwise than by acceleration and all sums paid or advanced by the Subordinated Note Indenture Trustee, including reasonable compensation and expenses of the Subordinated Note Indenture Trustee.The holders of not less than a majority in aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Junior Subordinated Notes of any series may, on behalf of the holders of all the Junior Subordinated Notes of such series, waive any past default with respect to such series, except (i)\\xa0a default in the payment of principal or interest (including Additional Interest) or (ii)\\xa0a default in respect of a covenant or provision which under Article Nine of the Subordinated Note Indenture cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the holder of each outstanding Junior Subordinated Note of such series affected.Registration and TransferThe Company shall not be required to (i)\\xa0issue, register the transfer of or exchange Junior Subordinated Notes of any series during a period of 15 days immediately preceding the date notice is given identifying the Junior Subordinated Notes of such series called for redemption or (ii)\\xa0issue, register the transfer of or exchange any Junior Subordinated Notes so selected for redemption, in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Junior Subordinated Note being redeemed in part.Payment and Paying AgentUnless otherwise indicated in an applicable Prospectus Supplement, payment of principal of any Junior Subordinated Notes will be made only against surrender to the Paying Agent of such Junior Subordinated Notes. Principal of and interest on Junior Subordinated Notes will be payable, subject to any applicable laws and regulations, at the office of such Paying Agent or Paying Agents as the Company may designate from time to time, except that, at the option of the Company, payment of any interest may be made by wire transfer or other electronic transfer or by check mailed to the address of the person entitled to an interest payment as such address shall appear in the Security Register with respect to the Junior Subordinated Notes. Payment of interest on Junior Subordinated Notes on any interest payment date will be made to the person in whose name the Junior Subordinated Notes (or predecessor security) are registered at the close of business on the record date for such interest payment.Unless otherwise indicated in an applicable Prospectus Supplement, the Subordinated Note Indenture Trustee will act as Paying Agent with respect to the Junior Subordinated Notes. The Company may at any time designate additional Paying Agents or rescind the designation of any Paying Agents or approve a change in the office through which any Paying Agent acts.All moneys paid by the Company to a Paying Agent for the payment of the principal of or interest on the Junior Subordinated Notes of any series which remain unclaimed at the end of two years after such principal or interest shall have become due and payable will be repaid to the Company, and the holder of such Junior Subordinated Notes will from that time forward look only to the Company for payment of such principal and interest.ModificationThe Subordinated Note Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and the Subordinated Note Indenture Trustee, with the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Junior Subordinated Notes of each series affected, to modify the Subordinated Note Indenture or the rights of the holders of the Junior Subordinated Notes of such series; provided that no such modification may, without the consent of the holder of each outstanding Junior Subordinated Note affected, (i)\\xa0change the stated maturity of the principal of, or any installment of principal of or interest on, any Junior Subordinated Note, or reduce the principal amount of any Junior Subordinated Note or the rate of interest (including Additional Interest) on any Junior Subordinated Note or any premium payable upon the redemption of any Junior Subordinated Note, or change the method of calculating the rate of interest on any Junior Subordinated Note, or impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after the stated maturity of any Junior Subordinated Note (or, in the case of redemption, on or after the redemption date), or (ii)\\xa0reduce the percentage of principal amount of the outstanding Junior Subordinated Notes of any series, the consent of whose holders is required for any such supplemental indenture, or the consent of whose holders is required for any waiver (of compliance with certain provisions of the Subordinated Note Indenture or certain defaults under the Subordinated Note Indenture and their consequences) provided for in the Subordinated Note Indenture, or (iii)\\xa0modify any of the provisions of the Subordinated Note Indenture relating to supplemental indentures, waiver of past defaults or waiver of certain covenants, except to increase any such percentage or to provide that certain other provisions of the Subordinated Note Indenture cannot be modified or waived without the consent of the holder of each outstanding Junior Subordinated Note affected thereby, or (iv)\\xa0modify the provisions of the Subordinated Note Indenture with respect to the subordination of the Junior Subordinated Notes in a manner adverse to such holder.In addition, the Company and the Subordinated Note Indenture Trustee may execute, without the consent of any holders of Junior Subordinated Notes, any supplemental indenture for certain other usual purposes, including the creation of any new series of Junior Subordinated Notes.Consolidation, Merger and SaleThe Company shall not consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or convey, transfer or lease its properties and assets substantially as an entirety to any person, unless (1)\\xa0such other corporation or person is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the United States, any state of the United States or the District of Columbia and such other corporation or person expressly assumes, by supplemental indenture executed and delivered to the Subordinated Note Indenture Trustee, the payment of the principal of and premium, if any, on and interest (including Additional Interest) on all the Junior Subordinated Notes and the performance of every covenant of the Subordinated Note Indenture on the part of the Company to be performed or observed; (2)\\xa0immediately after giving effect to such transactions, no Subordinated Note Indenture Event of Default, and no event which, after notice or lapse of time or both, would become a Subordinated Note Indenture Event of Default, shall have happened and be continuing; and (3)\\xa0the Company has delivered to the Subordinated Note Indenture Trustee an officers’ certificate and an opinion of counsel, each stating that such transaction complies with the provisions of the Subordinated Note Indenture governing consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer or lease and that all conditions precedent to the transaction have been complied with.Information Concerning the Subordinated Note Indenture TrusteeThe Subordinated Note Indenture Trustee, prior to a Subordinated Note Indenture Event of Default with respect to Junior Subordinated Notes of any series, undertakes to perform, with respect to Junior Subordinated Notes of such series, only such duties as are specifically set forth in the Subordinated Note Indenture and, in case a Subordinated Note Indenture Event of Default with respect to Junior Subordinated Notes of any series has occurred and is continuing, shall exercise, with respect to Junior Subordinated Notes of such series, the same degree of care as a prudent individual would exercise in the conduct of his or her own affairs. Subject to such provision, the Subordinated Note Indenture Trustee is under no obligation to exercise any of the powers vested in it by the Subordinated Note Indenture at the request of any holder of Junior Subordinated Notes of any series, unless offered reasonable indemnity by such holder against the costs, expenses and liabilities which might be incurred by the Subordinated Note Indenture Trustee. The Subordinated Note Indenture Trustee is not required to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of its duties if the Subordinated Note Indenture Trustee reasonably believes that repayment or adequate indemnity is not reasonably assured to it.The Subordinated Note Indenture Trustee also serves as Senior Note Indenture Trustee. The Company and certain of its subsidiaries may maintain deposit accounts and banking relationships with the Subordinated Note Indenture Trustee. The Subordinated Note Indenture Trustee and certain of its affiliates may also serve as trustee under other indentures pursuant to which securities of the Company and certain subsidiaries of the Company are outstanding.Governing LawThe Subordinated Note Indenture and the Junior Subordinated Notes will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of New York.MiscellaneousThe Company will have the right at all times to assign any of its rights or obligations under the Subordinated Note Indenture to a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company; provided, that, in the event of any such assignment, the Company will remain primarily liable for all such obligations. Subject to the foregoing, the Subordinated Note Indenture will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties to the Subordinated Note Indenture and their respective successors and assigns.DESCRIPTION OF THE STOCK PURCHASE CONTRACTS AND THE STOCK PURCHASE UNITSThe Company may issue Stock Purchase Contracts, including contracts that obligate holders to purchase from the Company, and the Company to sell to these holders, a specified or varying number of shares of Common Stock at a future date or dates. The consideration per share of Common Stock may be fixed at the time the Stock Purchase Contracts are issued or may be determined by reference to a specific formula set forth in the Stock Purchase Contracts. The Stock Purchase Contracts may be issued separately or as a part of Stock Purchase Units consisting of a Stock Purchase Contract and beneficial interests in either debt securities of the Company or debt securities of third parties including, but not limited to, U.S. Treasury securities, that would secure the holders’ obligations to purchase the Common Stock under the Stock Purchase Contracts. The Stock Purchase Contracts may require the Company to make periodic payments to the holders of some or all of the Stock Purchase Units or vice versa, and such payments may be unsecured or prefunded on some basis and may be paid on a current or deferred basis. The Stock Purchase Contracts may require holders to secure their obligations under these Stock Purchase Contracts in a specified manner.
