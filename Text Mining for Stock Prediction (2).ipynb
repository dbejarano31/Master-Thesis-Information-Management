       "\"Investing in our common stock involves risk. Before deciding whether to invest in our common stock, you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below. You should also consider the risks, uncertainties and assumptions discussed under the heading “Risk Factors” included in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, as revised or supplemented by our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q, each of which are on file with the SEC and are incorporated herein by reference, and which may be amended, supplemented or superseded from time to time by other reports we file with the SEC in the future. There may be other unknown or unpredictable economic, business, competitive, regulatory or other factors that could have material adverse effects on our future results. If any of these risks actually occurs, our business, business prospects, financial condition or results of operations could be seriously harmed. This could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline, resulting in a loss of all or part of your investment. Please also read carefully the section below entitled “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.” Risks Related to This Offering and Our Common StockWe will have broad discretion in the use of the net proceeds from this offering and may not use them effectively.We currently intend to use the net proceeds of this offering for working capital and general corporate purposes, as further described in the section of this prospectus supplement entitled “Use of Proceeds.” We will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds and investors will be relying on the judgment of our management regarding the application of the proceeds of this offering. The failure by our management to apply these funds effectively could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Pending their use, we may invest the net proceeds from this offering in interest-bearing instruments. These investments may not yield a favorable return, or any return, to us or our stockholders.You may experience immediate and substantial dilution.The offering price per share in this offering may exceed the net tangible book value per share of our common stock outstanding prior to this offering. Assuming that an aggregate of 4,030,400 shares of our common stock are sold during the term of the Equity Distribution Agreement with the Sales Agents at a price of $43.42 per share, the last reported sale price of our common stock on Nasdaq on November 18, 2020, for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $175.0 million, after deducting commissions and estimated aggregate offering expenses payable by us, you will experience immediate dilution of $30.38 per share, representing the difference between the assumed offering price and our as adjusted net tangible book value per share as of September 30, 2020 after giving effect to this offering. The exercise of outstanding stock options and vesting of other stock awards may result in further dilution of your investment. See the section entitled “Dilution” appearing elsewhere in this prospectus supplement for a more detailed illustration of the dilution you would incur if you participate in this offering.The actual number of shares we will issue under the Equity Distribution Agreement with the Sales Agents, at any one time or in total, is uncertain.Subject to certain limitations in the Equity Distribution Agreement with the Sales Agents and compliance with applicable law, we have the discretion to deliver placement notices to the Sales Agents at any time throughout the term of the Equity Distribution Agreement. The number of shares that are sold by the Sales Agents after delivering a placement notice may fluctuate based on the market price of the common stock during the sales period and limits we set with the Sales Agents.You may experience future dilution as a result of future equity offerings.In order to raise additional capital, we may in the future offer additional shares of our common stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock at prices that may not be the same as the price per share in this offering. We may sell shares or other securities in any other offering at a price per share that is less than the price per share paid by investors in this offering, and investors purchasing shares or other securities in the future could have rights superior to existing stockholders. The price per share at which we sell additional shares of our common stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into common stock, in future transactions may be higher or lower than the price per share paid by investors in this offering.We do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock, so any returns will be limited to the value of our common stock. We currently anticipate that we will retain any future earnings to finance the continued development, operation and expansion of our business. As a result, we do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends or other distributions in the foreseeable future. Further, if we were to enter into a credit facility or issue debt securities or preferred stock in the future, we may become contractually restricted from paying dividends. If we do not pay dividends, our common stock may be less valuable because stockholders must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, to realize any gains on their investment. The sale of our common stock in this offering and any future sales of our common stock may depress our stock price and our ability to raise funds in new stock offerings.Sales of our common stock in this offering and the public market following this offering could lower the market price of our common stock. Sales may also make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that our management deems acceptable, or at all. Investing\\nin our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties and all other information\\ncontained in or incorporated by reference into this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus, including the risks\\nand uncertainties described below and under the caption “Risk Factors” in the accompanying prospectus and in our most\\nrecently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Report on 10-Q filed with the SEC, in each case as these risk factors\\nare amended or supplemented by subsequent Annual Reports on Form 10-K or Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q that have been or will\\nbe incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement, including any amendments thereto. The risks set forth below and incorporated\\nherein by reference are those which we believe are the material risks that we face. The occurrence of any of such risks may materially\\nand adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects. In such an event, the market\\nprice of our common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.Risks\\nRelated to this Offering, our Developing Growth Strategy, and Ownership of Our Common Stock Purchasers\\nin the offering will suffer immediate dilution.If you purchase common stock in this offering, the value of\\nyour shares based on our actual book value will immediately be less than the offering price you paid. This reduction in the value\\nof your equity is known as dilution. At the public offering price of $13.25 per share, purchasers of common stock in this offering\\nwill experience immediate dilution of approximately $12.06 per share. Based upon the as adjusted net tangible book value of our\\ncommon stock at September 30, 2020 (as adjusted for certain issuances that occurred after such date), your shares may be worth\\nless per share than the price you paid in the offering. See “Dilution.” If the options, warrants and convertible securities\\nwe previously granted are exercised, additional dilution will occur. As of November 17, 2020, options and deferred stock units\\nto purchase 3,426,459 shares of common stock at a weighted-average exercise price of $3.66 per share were outstanding and warrants\\nto purchase 1,301,979 shares of common stock at a weighted-average exercise price of $2.46 per share were outstanding. Furthermore,\\nif we raise additional funding by issuing additional equity securities, the newly-issued shares will further dilute your percentage\\nownership of our shares and may also reduce the value of your investment.S-4The\\nnotes to our financials for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 include an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial\\ndoubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.The\\nnotes accompanying our December 31, 2019 and 2018 audited financial statements contain an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial\\ndoubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K were prepared\\n“assuming that we will continue as a\\xa0going concern.” Our ability to continue as a\\xa0going concern is dependent\\non raising additional capital to fund our operations and ultimately on generating future profitable operations. There can be no\\nassurance that we will be able to raise sufficient additional capital or eventually have positive cash flow from operations to\\naddress all of our cash flow needs. If we are not able to find alternative sources of cash, or generate positive cash flow from\\noperations, our operations, business and shareholders may be materially and adversely affected.We\\nmay be required to raise additional financing by issuing new securities with terms or rights superior to those of our existing\\nshareholders, or at a price per share that is less than the price per share paid by investors in this offering, which could adversely\\naffect the market price of shares of our common stock and our business.We\\nwill require additional financing to fund future operations, including our research, development, sales and marketing activities.\\nWe may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms, if at all. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities,\\nwe may sell shares or other securities in any other offering at a price per share that is less than the price per share paid by\\ninvestors in this offering. Additionally, if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, the percentage ownership\\nof our current shareholders will be reduced, and, if the equity securities issued are preferred shares, the holders of the new\\npreferred shares may have rights superior to those of our existing securityholders, which could adversely affect rights of our\\nexisting securityholders and the market price of our common stock. If we raise additional funds by issuing debt securities, the\\nholders of those debt securities would have some rights senior to those of our existing securityholders, and the terms of these\\ndebt securities could impose restrictions on operations and create a significant interest expense for us which could have a materially\\nadverse effect on our business.Our\\nshare price may be volatile, which could subject us to securities class action litigation and prevent you from being able to sell\\nyour shares at or above the offering price.Our\\nstock could be subject to wide fluctuation in response to many risk factors listed in this section or incorporated by reference\\ninto this prospectus, and others beyond our control, including:\\n●\\nMarket\\n                                         acceptance and commercialization of our products;\\n\\n●\\nOur\\n                                         being able to timely demonstrate achievement of milestones, including those related to\\n                                         revenue generation, cost control, cost effective source supply and regulatory approvals;\\n\\n●\\nRegulatory\\n                                         developments or enforcements in the United States and non-U.S. countries with respect\\n                                         to our products or our competitors’ products;\\n\\n●\\nFailure\\n                                         to achieve pricing acceptable to the market;\\n\\n●\\nActual\\n                                         or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results, or our\\n                                         continuing to sustain operating losses;\\n\\n●\\nCompetition\\n                                         from existing products or new products that may emerge;\\n\\n●\\nAnnouncements\\n                                         by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures,\\n                                         collaborations or capital commitments;\\n\\n●\\nIssuance\\n                                         of new or updated research or reports by securities analysts;\\nS-5\\n●\\nAnnouncement\\n                                         or expectation of additional financing efforts, particularly if our cash available for\\n                                         operations significantly decreases;\\n\\n●\\nFluctuations\\n                                         in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\\n\\n●\\nShare\\n                                         price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our\\n                                         shares;\\n\\n●\\nAdditions\\n                                         or departures of key management personnel;\\n\\n●\\nDisputes\\n                                         or other developments related to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters\\n                                         and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;\\n\\n●\\nEntry\\n                                         by us into any material litigation or other proceedings;\\n\\n●\\nSales\\n                                         of our common stock by us, our insiders, or our other shareholders;\\n\\n●\\nMarket\\n                                         conditions for stocks in general; and\\n\\n●\\nGeneral\\n                                         economic and market conditions unrelated to our performance.\\nFurthermore,\\nthe stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market\\nprices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating\\nperformance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political, and market\\nconditions such as recessions, interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations, may negatively impact the market\\nprice of shares of our common stock. In addition, such fluctuations could subject us to securities class action litigation, which\\ncould result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously\\nharm our business. If the market price of shares of our common stock after this offering does not exceed the initial public offering\\nprice, you may not realize any return on your investment in us and may lose some or all of your investment.If\\nsecurities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our\\nstock price and trading volume could decline.The\\ntrading market for our common stock is impacted by the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about\\nus or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. We cannot assure that analysts will continue to cover us or\\nprovide favorable coverage. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or change their opinion of our stock,\\nour share price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports\\non us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.Management\\nwill have broad discretion as to the use of the proceeds from this offering and may not use the proceeds effectively.Our\\nmanagement will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds from this offering and could spend the proceeds in\\nways that may not improve our results of operations or enhance the value of our securities. Our failure to apply these funds effectively\\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business and cause the price of our common stock to decline.Future\\nsales, or the possibility of future sales, of a substantial number of shares of our common stock could adversely affect the price\\nof the shares and dilute shareholders.Future\\nsales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock, or the perception that such sales will occur, could cause a decline\\nin the market price of our common stock. This is particularly true if we sell our stock at a discount. If, after the end of such\\nlock-up agreements, these shareholders sell substantial amounts of common stock in the public market, or the market perceives\\nthat such sales may occur, the market price of our common stock and our ability to raise capital through an issue of equity securities\\nin the future could be adversely affected.In\\naddition, in the future, we may issue additional shares of common stock or other equity or debt securities convertible into common\\nstock in connection with a financing, acquisition, litigation settlement, employee arrangements or otherwise. Any such issuance\\ncould result in substantial dilution to our existing shareholders and could cause our common share price to decline.S-6We\\nhave not paid cash dividends in the past and do not expect to pay dividends in the future. Any return on investment may be limited\\nto the value of our common stock.We\\nhave never paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends\\non our common stock will depend on earnings, financial condition and other business and economic factors affecting us at such\\ntime as our board of directors may consider relevant. If we do not pay dividends, our common stock may be less valuable because\\na return on your investment will only occur if our stock price appreciates.We\\nare an “emerging growth company” as that term is used in the JOBS Act, and we intend to continue to take advantage\\nof reduced disclosure and governance requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, which could result in our common stock\\nbeing less attractive to investors and adversely affect the market price of our common stock or make it more difficult to raise\\ncapital as and when we need it.We\\nare an “emerging growth company” as that term is used in the JOBS Act, and we intend to continue to take advantage\\nof certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging\\ngrowth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section\\n404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy\\nstatements, exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval\\nof any golden parachute payments not previously approved, and exemptions from any rules that the Public Company Accounting Oversight\\nBoard may adopt requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report on the financial statements.\\nWe currently take advantage of some, but not all, of the reduced regulatory and reporting requirements that are available to us\\nunder the JOBS Act, and intend to continue to do so as long as we qualify as an “emerging growth company.” For example,\\nso long as we qualify as an “emerging growth company,” we may elect not to provide you with certain information, including\\ncertain financial information and certain information regarding compensation of our executive officers, that we would have otherwise\\nbeen required to provide in filings we make with the SEC, which may make it more difficult for investors and securities analysts\\nto evaluate us.We\\ncannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors\\nfind our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock\\nprice may be more volatile. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company,\\nwhich in certain circumstances could be for up to five years. See “Prospectus Supplement Summary — Implications of\\nBeing an Emerging Growth Company.”Because\\nof the exemptions from various reporting requirements provided to us as an “emerging growth company,” we may be less\\nattractive to investors and it may be difficult for us to raise additional capital as and when we need it. Investors may be unable\\nto compare our business with other companies in our industry if they believe that our financial accounting is not as transparent\\nas other companies in our industry. If we are unable to raise additional capital as and when we need it, our business, results\\nof operations, financial condition and cash flows, and future prospects may be materially and adversely affected.S-7CAUTIONARY\\nNOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSThis\\nprospectus supplement contains “forward-looking statements.” Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited\\nto, statements that express our intentions, beliefs, expectations, strategies, predictions or any other statements relating to\\nour future activities or other future events or conditions. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and\\nprojections about our business based, in part, on assumptions made by management. These statements are not guarantees of future\\nperformance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results\\nmay, and are likely to, differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements due to numerous\\nfactors discussed from time to time in this prospectus and in other documents which we file with the SEC. In addition, such statements\\ncould be affected by risks and uncertainties related to:\\n\\n●\\nour\\n    ability to identify financing sources to fund our capital expenditure requirements and continue operations until sufficient\\n    cash flow can be generated from operations;\\n\\n●\\nour\\n    ability to effectively execute our business plan and growth strategy;\\n\\n●\\nunforeseen\\n    or recurring operational problems at our facility, or a catastrophic loss of our manufacturing facility, including the temporary closure of our facility due to COVID-19;\\n\\n●\\nour\\n    dependence on our suppliers, whose ability to supply us may be negatively impacted by the measures being implemented to address\\n    COVID-19;\\n\\n●\\nthe\\n    volatility of our stock price;\\n\\n●\\nchanges\\n    in consumer demand for, and acceptance of, our products;\\n\\n●\\noverall\\n    strength and stability of general economic conditions and of the automotive industry more specifically, both in the United\\n    States and globally;\\n\\n●\\nchanges\\n    in U.S. and foreign trade policy, including the imposition of tariffs and the resulting consequences;\\n\\n●\\nchanges\\n    in the competitive environment, including adoption of technologies and products that compete with our products;\\n\\n●\\nour\\n    ability to generate consistent revenues;\\n\\n●\\nour\\n    ability to design, produce and market our vehicles within projected timeframes given that a vehicle consists of several thousand\\n    unique items and we can only go as fast as the slowest item;\\n\\n●\\nour\\n    inexperience to date in manufacturing vehicles at the high volumes that we anticipate;\\n\\n●\\nour\\n    reliance on key personnel;\\n\\n●\\nchanges\\n    in the price of oil and electricity;\\n\\n●\\nchanges\\n    in laws or regulations governing our business and operations;\\n\\n●\\nour\\n    ability to maintain adequate liquidity and financing sources and an appropriate level of debt, if any, on terms favorable\\n    to our company;\\n\\n●\\nthe\\n    number of reservations and cancellations for our vehicles and our ability to deliver on those reservations;\\n\\n●\\nour\\n    ability to maintain quality control over our vehicles and avoid material vehicle recalls;\\n\\n●\\nour\\n    ability to manage the distribution channels for our products, including our ability to successfully implement our direct to\\n    consumer distribution strategy and any additional distribution strategies we may deem appropriate;\\n\\n●\\nour\\n    ability to obtain and protect our existing intellectual property protections including patents;\\n\\n●\\nchanges\\n    in accounting principles, or their application or interpretation, and our ability to make estimates and the assumptions underlying\\n    the estimates, which could have an effect on earnings or losses;\\n\\n●\\ninterest\\n    rates and the credit markets;\\n\\n●\\nour\\n    ability to maintain our Nasdaq Capital Market listing;\\n\\n●\\ncosts\\n    and risks associated with litigation; and\\n\\n●\\nother\\n    risks described from time to time in periodic and current reports that we file with the SEC.\\nYou\\nshould read this prospectus supplement, the accompanying prospectus and the documents that we incorporate by reference herein\\nand therein completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we currently\\nexpect. You should assume that the information appearing in this prospectus supplement, the accompanying prospectus and any document\\nincorporated by reference herein and therein is accurate as of its date only. Because the risks referred to above could cause\\nactual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf,\\nyou should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. Further, any forward-looking statement speaks only as of\\nthe date on which it is made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances\\nafter the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. New factors emerge from time\\nto time, and it is not possible for us to predict which factors may arise. In addition, we cannot assess the impact of each factor\\non our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from\\nthose contained in any forward-looking statements. We qualify all of the information presented in this prospectus supplement,\\nthe accompanying prospectus, any other prospectus supplement and any document incorporated herein or therein by reference, and\\nparticularly our forward-looking statements, by these cautionary statements.S-8USE\\nOF PROCEEDSWe estimate that the net proceeds from the sale of the shares\\nof common stock that we are offering will be approximately $14.1\\xa0million, after deducting the placement agent fees and estimated\\noffering expenses payable by us.We intend to use the net proceeds from the sale of our common\\nstock under this prospectus supplement for general corporate purposes, including to cover our operating expenses and inventory.The\\namounts and timing of our use of the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes will depend on a number of\\nfactors, such as the timing and progress of our research and development efforts and the timing and progress of any collaborative\\nor strategic partnering efforts. As of the date of this prospectus supplement, we cannot specify with certainty all of the particular\\nuses for the net proceeds to us from this offering. Accordingly, our management will have broad discretion in the timing and application\\nof these proceeds.DIVIDEND\\nPOLICYWe\\nhave never declared dividends on our equity securities, and currently do not plan to declare dividends on shares of our common\\nstock in the foreseeable future. We expect to retain our future earnings, if any, for use in the operation and expansion of our\\nbusiness. The payment of cash dividends in the future, if any, will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend\\nupon such factors as earnings levels, capital requirements, our overall financial condition and any other factors deemed relevant\\nby our Board of Directors.Accordingly, you may need to sell your shares of our common\\nstock to realize a return on your investment, and you may not be able to sell your shares at or above the price you paid for them.\\nSee “Risk Factors—Risks Related to this Offering, Our Developing Growth Strategy, and Ownership of Our Common Stock—We\\nhave not paid cash dividends in the past and do not expect to pay dividends in the future. Any return on investment may be limited\\nto the value of our common stock.”S-9DILUTIONOur net tangible book value as of September 30, 2020, as adjusted\\nto give effect to certain issuances that occurred after such date, was approximately $25,041,063, or $0.79 per share of common\\nstock. Net tangible book value per share is calculated by subtracting our total liabilities from our total tangible assets, which\\nis total assets less intangible assets, and dividing this amount by the number of shares of common stock outstanding as of such\\ndate. After giving effect to the sale by us of 1,132,075 shares of common stock being offered in this offering at an offering price\\nof $13.25 per share and after deducting the placement agent fees and estimated offering expenses payable by us, and as adjusted\\nto give effect to certain issuances that occurred after September 30, 2020, our as-adjusted net tangible book value as of September\\n30, 2020 would have been approximately $39,191,057, or $1.19 per share of common stock. This represents an immediate increase in\\nthe net tangible book value of $0.40 per share to our existing shareholders and an immediate and substantial dilution in net tangible\\nbook value of $12.06 per share to new investors.

These provisions are expected to encourage persons seeking\\nto acquire control of our Company to first negotiate with our board of directors. We believe that the benefits of increasing our\\nability to negotiate with the proponent of an unfriendly or unsolicited proposal to acquire or restructure our Company outweigh\\nthe disadvantages of discouraging these proposals because negotiation of these proposals could result in an improvement of their\\nterms.Oregon\\nBusiness Combination ActWe\\nare subject to the Oregon Business Combination Act, an anti-takeover law. In general, the Oregon Business Combination Act prohibits\\na publicly held Oregon corporation from engaging in a “business combination” with an “interested shareholder”\\nfor a period of three years following the date the person became an interested shareholder, unless:\\n\\n●\\nthe\\n    board of directors approves the transaction in which the shareholder became an interested shareholder prior to the date the\\n    interested shareholder attained that status;\\n\\n●\\nwhen\\n    the shareholder became an interested shareholder, he or she owned at least 85% of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding\\n    at the time the transaction commenced, excluding shares owned by directors and officers and certain shares owned by employee\\n    benefits plans; or\\n\\n●\\non\\n    or subsequent to the date the business combination is approved by the board of directors, the business combination is authorized\\n    by the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3% of the voting stock not owned by the interested shareholder.\\nGenerally,\\na “business combination” includes a merger, asset or stock sale, or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit\\nto the interested shareholder. Generally, an “interested shareholder” is a person who, together with affiliates and\\nassociates, owns, or is an affiliate or associate of the corporation and within three years prior to the determination of interested\\nshareholder status did own, 15% or more of a corporation’s voting stock.Oregon\\nControl Share ActWe\\nare subject to the Oregon Control Share Act, under which a person who acquires voting stock in a transaction that results in the\\nperson holding more than 20%, 33 1/3% or 50% of the total voting power cannot vote the shares it acquires in the acquisition unless\\nvoting rights are accorded to such control shares:\\n\\n●\\nby\\n    the holders of a majority of the outstanding voting shares, excluding the control shares held by such person and shares held\\n    by our officers and directors who are also employees of our Company, or inside directors; and\\n\\n●\\nby\\n    the holders of a majority of the outstanding voting shares, including the control shares held by such person and shares held\\n    by our officers and inside directors.\\nThis\\nvote would be required at the time an acquiring person’s holdings exceed 20% of the total voting power, and again at the\\ntime the acquiring person’s holdings exceed 33 1/3% and 50%, respectively.The\\nOregon Control Share Act and the Oregon Business Combination Act could have the effect of encouraging potential acquirers to negotiate\\nwith our board of directors and discourage potential acquirers unwilling to comply with the provisions of these laws. These laws\\nalso may delay, defer or prevent a tender offer or takeover attempt of our Company that a shareholder might consider in the shareholder’s\\nbest interest, including those attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares held by our shareholders.\\nAn Oregon corporation may provide in its articles of incorporation or bylaws that the laws described above do not apply to its\\nshares. We have not adopted such a provision and do not currently intend to do so.S-12Charter\\nDocumentsOur\\nRestated Articles and Bylaws include a number of provisions that may have the effect of deterring acquisition proposals or delaying\\nor preventing changes in control or management of our Company.Restated\\nArticles\\n\\n●\\nBest\\n    Interests of the Company. Oregon law and our Restated Articles authorize our board of directors, in all matters, to consider\\n    the social, legal and economic effects on our employees and on the communities and geographical areas in which we operate,\\n    the long-term and short-term interests of us and our shareholders, and our effect on the environment. Because our board of\\n    directors is not required to make any determination on matters affecting potential takeovers solely based on its judgment\\n    as to the best interests of our shareholders, our board could act in a manner that would discourage an acquisition attempt\\n    or other transaction that some, or a majority, of our shareholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which\\n    such shareholders might receive a premium for their stock over the then market price of such stock.\\n\\n●\\nNo\\n    Cumulative Voting. Our Restated Articles do not include a provision for cumulative voting for directors. Under cumulative\\n    voting, a minority shareholder holding a sufficient percentage of a class of shares may be able to ensure the election of\\n    one or more directors.\\n\\n●\\nPreferred\\n    Stock. We are authorized to issue “blank check” preferred stock, which, although intended primarily as a financing\\n    tool and not as a defense against takeovers, could potentially be used by our board of directors, without any further vote\\n    or action by our shareholders, to make uninvited attempts to acquire control more difficult by, for example, diluting the\\n    ownership interest or voting power of a substantial shareholder, increasing the consideration necessary to effect an acquisition\\n    or selling unissued shares to a friendly third party. \\nBylaws\\n\\n●\\nAmendments.\\n    Our board of directors may alter our Bylaws without obtaining shareholder approval.\\n\\n●\\nNumber\\n    of Directors. The number of directors on our board, which may range from one to five directors, may be changed by resolution\\n    of the board of directors without any further vote or action by our shareholders.\\n\\n●\\nBoard\\n    Vacancies. Newly created directorships resulting from an increase in our authorized number of directors and vacancies\\n    in our board resulting from death, resignation or removal will be filled by a majority of our board then in office.\\nThese\\nprovisions of our Restated Articles, our Bylaws and Oregon law could discourage potential acquisition proposals and delay or prevent\\na change in control or management of our Company.LEGAL\\nMATTERSNelson\\nMullins Riley  Scarborough LLP has passed upon the validity of the common stock offered by this prospectus supplement.EXPERTSThe\\nfinancial statements of Arcimoto, Inc. included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K as of December 31, 2019 and\\n2018 and for the years then ended have been audited by dbbmckennon, independent registered public accounting firm, as set\\nforth in their report thereon and incorporated herein by reference.

These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about our\\nbusiness based, in part, on assumptions made by management. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve\\nrisks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may, and are likely\\nto, differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements due to numerous factors discussed\\nfrom time to time in this prospectus and in other documents which we file with the SEC.

You should assume that the information appearing\\nin this prospectus and any document incorporated by reference is accurate as of its date only.

Further, any forward-looking statement\\nspeaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect\\nevents or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. New\\nfactors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict which factors will arise. In addition, we cannot assess\\nthe impact of each factor on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results\\nto differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. We qualify all of the information presented in this\\nprospectus, any accompanying prospectus supplement and any document incorporated herein by reference, and particularly our forward-looking\\nstatements, by these cautionary statements.\\n6\\n\\nUSE\\nOF PROCEEDSWe\\ncannot assure you that we will receive any proceeds in connection with securities offered by us pursuant to this prospectus.

Under our Restated Articles, our board of directors\\nhas the authority, without further action by shareholders, to provide for the issuance of all or any shares of the preferred stock\\nin one or more series and provide that the shares of each such series may be (a) subject to redemption at such time or times and\\nat such price or prices; (b) entitled to receive dividends (which may be cumulative or non-cumulative) at such rates, on such\\nconditions and at such times, and payable in preference to, or in such relation to, the dividends payable on any other class or\\nclasses or any other series; (c) entitled to such rights upon the dissolution of, or upon any distribution of the assets of, the\\nCompany; (d) convertible into, or exchangeable for, shares of any other class or classes of stock, or of any other series of the\\nsame or any other class or classes of stock of the Company at such price or prices or at such rates of exchange, and with such\\nadjustments, if any; (e) entitled to the benefit of such limitations, if any, on the issuance of additional shares of such series\\nor shares of any other series of preferred stock; or (f) entitled to such other preferences, powers, qualifications, rights and\\nprivileges, all as the board of directors may deem advisable and as are not inconsistent with the law and the provisions of the\\nRestated Articles.\\n10\\n\\nIf\\nwe issue preferred stock, we will fix the rights, preferences, privileges, qualifications and restrictions of the preferred stock\\nof each series that we sell under this prospectus and applicable prospectus supplements in a certificate of amendment to our Restated\\nArticles relating to that series. We will also incorporate by reference into the registration statement, of which this prospectus\\nis a part, the form of any certificate of amendment that describes the terms of the series of preferred stock we are offering\\nbefore the issuance of the related series of preferred stock. We urge you to read the prospectus supplement related to any series\\nof preferred stock we may offer, as well as the complete certificate of amendment that contains the terms of the applicable series\\nof preferred stock. It is not possible to state the actual effect of the issuance of any shares of preferred stock upon the rights\\nof holders of our common stock until our board of directors determines the specific rights of the holders of the preferred stock.\\nHowever, these effects might include restricting dividends on the common stock, diluting the voting power of the common stock,\\nimpairing the liquidation rights of the common stock, and delaying or preventing a the completion of a merger, tender offer or\\nother takeover attempt.\\xa0All\\nshares of preferred stock offered will, when issued, be fully paid and nonassessable, including shares of preferred stock issued\\nupon the exercise or exchange of any other securities described in this prospectus.The\\nOregon Revised Statutes provide that the holders of preferred stock will have the right to vote separately as a class on any proposal\\ninvolving fundamental changes in the rights of holders of that preferred stock. This right is in addition to any voting rights\\nthat may be provided for in the applicable certificate of amendment.Our\\nboard of directors may authorize the issuance of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect\\nthe voting power or other rights of the holders of our common stock. Preferred stock could be issued quickly with terms designed\\nto delay or prevent a change in control of our Company or make removal of management more difficult. Additionally, the issuance\\nof preferred stock may have the effect of decreasing the market price of our common stock.DESCRIPTION\\nOF WARRANTSThe\\nfollowing description, together with the additional information we may include in any applicable prospectus supplement, summarizes\\nthe material terms and provisions of the warrants that we may offer under this prospectus and any related warrant agreement and\\nwarrant certificate.

Particular terms of any rights we offer will be described in the prospectus supplement relating\\nto such rights.GeneralWe\\nmay issue rights to purchase common stock, preferred stock, debt securities or units.

Rights may be exercised as set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement beginning\\non the date specified therein and continuing until the close of business on the expiration date set forth in the prospectus supplement\\nrelating to the rights offered thereby. After the close of business on the expiration date, unexercised rights will become void.Upon\\nreceipt of payment and a rights certificate properly completed and duly executed at the corporate trust office of the subscription\\nagent or any other office indicated in the prospectus supplement, we will, as soon as practicable, forward the securities purchasable\\nupon such exercise. If less than all of the rights represented by such subscription certificate are exercised, a new subscription\\ncertificate will be issued for the remaining rights. If we so indicate in the applicable prospectus supplement, holders of the\\nrights may surrender securities as all or part of the exercise price for rights.We\\nmay determine to offer any unsubscribed offered securities directly to shareholders, persons other than shareholders, to or through\\nagents, underwriters or dealers or through a combination of such methods, including pursuant to standby underwriting, backstop\\nor other arrangements, as set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement.Prior\\nto exercising their rights, holders of rights will not have any of the rights of holders of the securities purchasable upon subscription,\\nincluding, in the case of rights to purchase common stock or preferred stock, the right to receive dividends, if any, or payments\\nupon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up or to exercise any voting rights or, in the case of rights to purchase debt securities,\\nthe right to receive principal, premium, if any, or interest payments, on the debt securities purchasable upon exercise or to\\nenforce covenants in the applicable indenture.CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF OREGON LAW, OUR\\nSECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED\\n ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION AND SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED BYLAWSCertain provisions of Oregon law, our Restated Articles and\\nour Bylaws discussed below may have the effect of making more difficult or discouraging a tender offer, proxy contest or other\\ntakeover attempt. These provisions are expected to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of our Company to first negotiate\\nwith our board of directors. We believe that the benefits of increasing our ability to negotiate with the proponent of an unfriendly\\nor unsolicited proposal to acquire or restructure our Company outweigh the disadvantages of discouraging these proposals because\\nnegotiation of these proposals could result in an improvement of their terms.Oregon Business Combination Act We are subject to the Oregon Business Combination Act, an anti-takeover\\nlaw. In general, the Oregon Business Combination Act prohibits a publicly held Oregon corporation from engaging in a “business\\ncombination” with an “interested shareholder” for a period of three years following the date the person became\\nan interested shareholder, unless:\\n●\\nthe board of directors approves the transaction in which the shareholder\\nbecame an interested shareholder prior to the date the interested shareholder attained that status;\\n\\n●\\nwhen the shareholder became an interested shareholder, he or she owned\\nat least 85% of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, excluding shares owned by\\ndirectors and officers and certain shares owned by employee benefits plans; or\\n\\n●\\non or subsequent to the date the business combination is approved\\nby the board of directors, the business combination is authorized by the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3% of the voting stock\\nnot owned by the interested shareholder.\\nGenerally, a “business combination” includes a merger,\\nasset or stock sale, or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested shareholder. Generally, an “interested\\nshareholder” is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, owns, or is an affiliate or associate of the corporation\\nand within three years prior to the determination of interested shareholder status did own, 15% or more of a corporation’s\\nvoting stock.\\n17\\n\\nOregon Control Share ActWe are subject to the Oregon Control Share Act, under which\\na person who acquires voting stock in a transaction that results in the person holding more than 20%, 33 1/3% or 50% of the total\\nvoting power cannot vote the shares it acquires in the acquisition unless voting rights are accorded to such control shares:\\n●\\nby the holders of a majority of the outstanding voting shares, excluding\\nthe control shares held by such person and shares held by our officers and directors who are also employees of our Company, or\\ninside directors; and\\n\\n●\\nby the holders of a majority of the outstanding voting shares, including\\nthe control shares held by such person and shares held by our officers and inside directors.\\nThis vote would be required at the time an acquiring person’s\\nholdings exceed 20% of the total voting power, and again at the time the acquiring person’s holdings exceed 33 1/3% and 50%,\\nrespectively.The Oregon Control Share Act and the Oregon Business Combination\\nAct could have the effect of encouraging potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors and discourage potential\\nacquirers unwilling to comply with the provisions of these laws. These laws also may delay, defer or prevent a tender offer or\\ntakeover attempt of our Company that a shareholder might consider in the shareholder’s best interest, including those attempts\\nthat might result in a premium over the market price for the shares held by our shareholders. An Oregon corporation may provide\\nin its articles of incorporation or bylaws that the laws described above do not apply to its shares. We have not adopted such a\\nprovision and do not currently intend to do so.Charter DocumentsOur Restated Articles and Bylaws include a number of provisions\\nthat may have the effect of deterring acquisition proposals or delaying or preventing changes in control or management of our Company.Restated Articles \\n●\\nBest Interests of the Company. Oregon law and our Restated\\nArticles authorize our board of directors, in all matters, to consider the social, legal and economic effects on our employees\\nand on the communities and geographical areas in which we operate, the long-term and short-term interests of us and our shareholders,\\nand our effect on the environment. Because our board of directors is not required to make any determination on matters affecting\\npotential takeovers solely based on its judgment as to the best interests of our shareholders, our board could act in a manner\\nthat would discourage an acquisition attempt or other transaction that some, or a majority, of our shareholders might believe to\\nbe in their best interests or in which such shareholders might receive a premium for their stock over the then market price of\\nsuch stock.\\n\\n●\\nNo Cumulative Voting. Our Restated Articles do not include\\na provision for cumulative voting for directors. Under cumulative voting, a minority shareholder holding a sufficient percentage\\nof a class of shares may be able to ensure the election of one or more directors. \\n\\n●\\nPreferred Stock. We are authorized to issue “blank check”\\npreferred stock, which, although intended primarily as a financing tool and not as a defense against takeovers, could potentially\\nbe used by our board of directors, without any further vote or action by our shareholders, to make uninvited attempts to acquire\\ncontrol more difficult by, for example, diluting the ownership interest or voting power of a substantial shareholder, increasing\\nthe consideration necessary to effect an acquisition or selling unissued shares to a friendly third party.\\nBylaws\\n●\\nAmendments. Our board of directors may alter our Bylaws without\\nobtaining shareholder approval. \\n\\n●\\nNumber of Directors. The number of directors on our board,\\nwhich may range from one to five directors, may be changed by resolution of the board of directors without any further vote or\\naction by our shareholders.\\n\\n●\\nBoard Vacancies. Newly created directorships resulting from\\nan increase in our authorized number of directors and vacancies in our board resulting from death, resignation or removal will\\nbe filled by a majority of our board then in office. \\nThese provisions of our Restated Articles, our Bylaws and Oregon\\nlaw could discourage potential acquisition proposals and delay or prevent a change in control or management of our Company\\n18\\n\\nLEGAL\\nMATTERSThe\\nvalidity of the securities being offered hereby will be passed upon by Wyrick Robbins Yates  Ponton LLP, Raleigh, North Carolina.EXPERTSThe\\nfinancial statements of Arcimoto, Inc. included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K as of December 31, 2017 and\\n2016 and for the years then ended have been audited by dbbmckennon, independent registered public accounting firm, as set\\nforth in their report thereon and incorporated herein by reference.

In consultation with your own financial, tax, accounting and legal advisers, you\\nshould carefully consider, among other matters, the factors set forth below as well as the risk factors discussed in the accompanying prospectus supplement, the accompanying prospectus and in our most recent annual and quarterly reports which are\\nincorporated by reference into this pricing supplement, the accompanying prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus before deciding to make an investment in the Notes. An investment in the Notes by a purchaser whose home currency is not Sterling entails significant risks. An investment in securities which are denominated and payable in a currency other than the currency of the country in which the purchaser is\\nresident or the currency in which the purchaser primarily conducts its business or activities (in each case, the “home currency”) entails significant risks not associated with securities denominated and payable in the home currency.\\nAccordingly, an investment in the Notes by a purchaser whose home currency is not Sterling entails significant risks. These risks include the possibility of significant changes in rates of exchange between the holder’s home currency\\nand Sterling, the possibility of the imposition or subsequent modification of foreign exchange controls and the possibility of tax consequences for the holder as a result of any foreign exchange gains resulting from an investment in the Notes.\\nThese risks generally depend on factors over which we have no control. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates between two currencies result from the interaction over time of many factors directly or indirectly affecting economic,\\nfinancial and political conditions in the countries issuing such currencies, and economic and political developments globally and in other relevant countries. Foreign currency exchange rates may be affected by, among other factors, existing and\\nexpected rates of inflation, existing and expected interest rate levels, the balance of payments between countries, the aggregate amount of a national government’s outstanding debt, and the extent of governmental surpluses or deficits in\\nvarious countries. All of these factors are, in turn, sensitive to the monetary, fiscal and trade policies pursued by the governments of various countries important to international trade and finance. Moreover, current global economic conditions and\\nthe actions taken or to be taken by various national governments in response to such conditions could significantly affect the exchange rates between Sterling and a holder’s home currency. Rates of exchange between Sterling and certain currencies have been highly volatile, and each holder should be aware that such volatility may\\ncontinue to occur. Fluctuations in any particular exchange rate that have occurred in the past, however, are not necessarily indicative of fluctuations in the rate that may occur during the term of the Notes. Depreciation of Sterling\\nagainst the holder’s home currency would result in a decrease in the effective yield of the Notes below its coupon rate and, in certain circumstances, could result in a loss to the holder. Appreciation of Sterling in relation to the\\nholder’s home currency could have the opposite effects. If, as permitted by the Notes, we make payments in U.S.\\xa0dollars, you will be exposed\\nto significant risks if your home currency is not U.S.\\xa0dollars. If Sterling is not available in our good faith judgment for the\\npayment of principal, premium, if any, or interest with respect to the Notes, including any payments made upon any redemption of the Notes, due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond the control of AHFC, or is no longer\\nused by the United Kingdom or for the settlement of transactions by public institutions of or within the international banking community, AHFC will be entitled to satisfy its obligations to holders of the Notes by making that payment in U.S. dollars\\non the basis of the market exchange rate as computed by the exchange rate agent on the second Business Day before that payment is due, or if such market exchange rate is not then available, on the basis of the most recently available market exchange\\nrate on or before the date that payment is due or as otherwise determined by AHFC in good faith, if the foregoing is impracticable. There can be no assurance that the exchange rate applicable to the Notes will be as favorable to the holders of such\\nNotes as the exchange rates that may otherwise be available to such holders at the applicable time of conversion. Any payment in respect of the Notes so made in U.S. dollars will not constitute a default under the Indenture (as defined below). If\\nyour home PS-3 \\ncurrency is not U.S. dollars, any such payment will expose you to the significant risks described above under “—An investment in the Notes by a purchaser whose home currency is not\\nSterling entails significant risks.” Neither the Trustee nor the Paying Agent shall be responsible for obtaining exchange rates, effecting conversions or otherwise handling redenominations.The potential developments regarding the\\navailability of Sterling and the possible conversion of amounts payable into U.S. dollars, or market perceptions concerning these and related issues, could adversely affect the value of the Notes. Foreign currency judgments are subject to exchange rate risks. The Indenture and the Notes will be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York. New York courts\\nwill normally enter judgments or decrees for money damages in the foreign currency in which foreign currency notes are denominated. These amounts are then converted into U.S.\\xa0dollars at the rate of exchange in effect on the date the judgment or\\ndecree is entered. Consequently, in a lawsuit for payment on the Notes, Noteholders would bear the currency exchange risk for the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and Sterling until a New York state court judgment is entered, which could be a\\nlong time. A Federal court sitting in New York with diversity jurisdiction over a dispute arising in connection with the Notes would apply the foregoing New York law. In courts outside of New York, Noteholders may not be able to obtain a judgment in a currency other than U.S.\\xa0dollars. For\\nexample, a judgment for money in an action based on the Notes in many other U.S.\\xa0federal or state courts ordinarily would be enforced in the United States only in U.S.\\xa0dollars. The date used to determine the rate of conversion of\\nSterling into U.S.\\xa0dollars would depend upon various factors, including which court renders the judgment. We cannot assure you that a trading\\nmarket for the Notes will ever develop or be maintained. The Notes are a new issue of securities and there currently is no secondary\\nmarket in which the Notes can be resold.\\xa0Although we intend to apply to list the Notes on the New York Stock Exchange, no assurance can be given that we will be able to list the Notes. Even if the Notes are listed, a secondary market may\\nnever develop or be maintained. If a secondary market does develop, it may not continue or it may not be sufficiently liquid to allow you to resell your Notes if or when you want to or at a price that you consider acceptable. From time to time, the\\nUnderwriters may make a market in the Notes, but any market making may be discontinued at any time. In evaluating the Notes, you should assume that you will be holding the Notes until their maturity. Noteholders are exposed to the consequences of denomination of a minimum specified denomination plus a higher integral multiple. The Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of £100,000 and integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof. As is the case\\nwith any issue of Notes that have a denomination consisting of a minimum specified denomination plus a higher integral multiple of another smaller amount, it is possible that the Notes may be traded in amounts in excess of £100,000 (or its\\nequivalent) that are not integral multiples of £100,000 (or its equivalent). In such a case a Noteholder who, as a result of trading such amounts, holds a principal amount of less than the minimum specified denomination may not receive\\na definitive note in respect of such holding (should definitive notes be printed) and would need to purchase a principal amount of Notes such that its holding amounts to the minimum specified denomination. The United Kingdom’s impending departure from the European Union could adversely affect the value of the Notes. The United Kingdom held a referendum on June\\xa023, 2016 in which a majority of voters voted to exit the European Union (“Brexit”)\\nand on March\\xa029, 2017, the United Kingdom submitted a formal notification of its intention to withdraw from the European Union pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon. On January\\xa031,\\nPS-4 \\n2020, the United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union under the terms of a withdrawal agreement which provides for a transition period that is currently expected to end on December\\xa031,\\n2020. During the transition period, the United Kingdom will essentially be treated as a member state of the European Union (except that the United Kingdom will not be represented by, or participate in, the decision-making bodies of the European\\nUnion) and the regulatory regime will remain the same across the United Kingdom and the European Union with all existing trading arrangements being maintained. The future relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union remains\\nuncertain as the two parties work through the transition period to negotiate the details of their future relationship, including the terms of trade between the United Kingdom and the European Union and potentially other countries. If the transition\\nperiod ends and no agreement is reached, the default scenario would be a “no-deal” Brexit in which the United Kingdom would leave the European Union with no agreements in place beyond (i)\\xa0any\\ntemporary arrangements that have or may be put in place by the European Union, or individual member states of the European Union, and the United Kingdom as part of no-deal contingency efforts and\\n(ii)\\xa0those conferred by mutual membership of the World Trade Organization. The effects of Brexit on the value of the Notes will\\ndepend on whatever agreements the United Kingdom makes to retain access to European Union markets either during a transitional period or more permanently. Brexit could adversely affect European and worldwide economic and market conditions and could\\ncontribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets, including volatility in the value of Sterling. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the United\\nKingdom determines which European Union laws to replace or replicate, including competition laws. Any of these effects of Brexit, and others we cannot anticipate, could negatively impact the liquidity and/or value of the Notes. PS-5 CURRENCY CONVERSION Principal, premium, if any, and interest payments in respect of the Notes, including any payments made upon any redemption in respect of the\\nNotes, will be payable in Sterling. If Sterling is not available in our good faith judgment for the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest with respect to the Notes, including any payments made upon any redemption of the Notes, due to\\nthe imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond the control of AHFC, or is no longer used by the United Kingdom or for the settlement of transactions by public institutions of or within the international banking community, AHFC\\nwill be entitled to satisfy its obligations to holders of the Notes by making that payment in U.S. dollars on the basis of the market exchange rate as computed by the exchange rate agent on the second Business Day before that payment is due, or if\\nsuch market exchange rate is not then available, on the basis of the most recently available market exchange rate on or before the date that payment is due or as otherwise determined by AHFC in good faith, if the foregoing is impracticable. Any payment in respect of the Notes so made in U.S. dollars will not constitute a default under the Indenture. Neither the Trustee nor the\\nPaying Agent shall be responsible for obtaining exchange rates, effecting conversions or otherwise handling redenominations. Investors\\nwill be subject to foreign exchange risks as to payments of principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on, the Notes, including any payments made upon any redemption of the Notes, that may have important economic and tax consequences to\\nthem. See “Risk Factors.” You should consult your own financial, legal and tax advisors as to the risks involved in an investment in the Notes. On November\\xa017, 2020, the Sterling/U.S.$ rate of exchange was £1.00/U.S.$1.3246, as reported by Bloomberg. Any information provided in this pricing supplement concerning exchange rates is provided as a matter of information only and you should not\\nregard it as indicative of the range of or trends in fluctuations in currency exchange rates that may occur in the future. PS-6 USE OF PROCEEDS We expect to receive net proceeds from the sale of the Notes, after deducting the underwriting discount and expenses payable by us, of\\napproximately £\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 , or $\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0, based on the Sterling/U.S.$\\nrate of exchange of £1.00/U.S.$1.3246 as of November\\xa017, 2020, as reported by Bloomberg. We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering for general corporate purposes. Pending such applications, such proceeds may be temporarily\\ninvested in short-term marketable securities. PS-7 DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES General The Notes are a tranche of our\\nMedium-Term Notes, Series A. The Notes will be issued under an indenture dated as of September\\xa05, 2013, between us and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee (the “Trustee”), as supplemented by the First Supplemental\\nIndenture, dated as of February\\xa08, 2018, between AHFC and the Trustee (as so supplemented, the “Indenture”). The terms of the Notes include those provisions contained in the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by\\nreference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the “Trust Indenture Act”). This description supplements, and to the extent inconsistent, supersedes, the description of the general terms and provisions of the debt\\nsecurities found in the accompanying prospectus and our Medium-Term Notes, Series A, described in the accompanying prospectus supplement.The following summary of specified provisions of the Indenture and the Notes does not purport to be\\ncomplete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the actual provisions of the Indenture, including the definitions contained in the Indenture of some of the terms used below, and the Notes,a copy of which has been\\nfiled as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this pricing supplement and accompanying prospectus supplement and prospectus are a part. The Notes initially will be limited to an aggregate principal amount of\\n£\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0. See “—Further Issuances” below. The Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of £100,000 and integral multiples\\nof £1,000 in excess thereof. The Notes will be our general unsecured and unsubordinated obligations, will rank equally with all of\\nour existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness from time to time outstanding and will be considered part of the same series of notes as any of our other Medium-Term Notes, Series A, previously issued or issued in the future. The\\nIndenture does not limit the amount of Notes, debentures or other evidence of indebtedness that we may issue under the Indenture or otherwise and provides that debt securities under the Indenture may be issued from time to time in one or more\\nseries. We have initially designated Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas as our paying agent (the “Paying Agent”), registrar\\nand transfer agent where Notes may be presented for payment. The entire principal amount of the Notes will mature and become payable,\\ntogether with unpaid interest, if any, accrued thereon on\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 (the “Stated Maturity Date”) unless redeemed earlier as described below under\\n“—Optional Redemption” and “—Redemption for Tax Reasons.” The Notes will not be subject to any sinking fund provisions and will not be convertible into or exchangeable for any of our equity interests. The principal of each Note payable at maturity or earlier redemption will be paid in Sterling against presentation and surrender at the office\\nor agency maintained for such purpose. Under the Indenture, holders of the Notes will vote with holders of all other tranches of our\\nMedium-Term Notes, Series\\xa0A, as a single class. As of November 17, 2020, we had approximately $21.45 billion\\xa0aggregate principal amount (approximately £16.19 billion\\xa0aggregate principal amount based on the Sterling/U.S.$ rate of\\nexchange of £1.00/U.S.$1.3246 as of November 17, 2020, as reported by Bloomberg), €4.30 billion aggregate principal amount (approximately £3.85 billion aggregate principal amount based on the Sterling/euro rate of exchange of\\n£1.00/€1.1166 as of November 17, 2020, as reported by Bloomberg) and £600.0\\xa0million aggregate principal amount of Medium-Term Notes, Series\\xa0A, outstanding under the Indenture. The Indenture contains provisions that require the consent of or action by a specified percentage of the aggregate principal amount of our\\nMedium-Term Notes, Series A, acting as a single class. For example, holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of our Medium-Term Notes, Series A, as a single class, may consent to certain modifications or amendments to the Indenture and\\nwaiver of certain continuing defaults under the PS-8 \\nIndenture, as described under “Description of Debt Securities—Modification, Waivers and Meetings” in the accompanying prospectus, and holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal\\namount of our Medium-Term Notes, Series A, as a single class, may declare the principal amount of our Medium-Term Notes, Series A, to be due and payable immediately upon the occurrence of certain events of default, as described under\\n“Description of Debt Securities—Events of Default” in the accompanying prospectus. Therefore, because the Medium-Term Notes, Series A, vote as a single class, a greater percentage of the principal amount of the Notes may be required\\nto take action under the Indenture and the aggregate principal amount of the Notes may not be sufficient to take action under the Indenture in the future. In addition, under the accompanying prospectus supplement, we may issue up to $30,000,000,000\\naggregate principal amount (approximately £22.65 billion\\xa0aggregate principal amount based on the Sterling/U.S.$ rate of exchange of £1.00/U.S.$1.3246 as of November\\xa017, 2020, as reported by Bloomberg) of Medium-Term Notes,\\nSeries A, under the Indenture, of which, as of November\\xa017, 2020, $10.79\\xa0billion aggregate principal amount (approximately £8.15 billion\\xa0aggregate principal amount based on the Sterling/U.S.$ rate of exchange of\\n£1.00/U.S.$1.3246 as of November\\xa017, 2020, as reported by Bloomberg) of Medium-Term Notes, Series A has previously been issued. We may increase the authorized aggregate principal amount of our Medium-Term Notes, Series A, at any time\\nwithout your consent. The Notes will bear interest\\nat\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0%\\xa0per\\xa0year and will accrue from\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 , 2020 (the\\n“Settlement Date”) or from the immediately preceding interest payment date to which interest has been paid. Interest on the Notes is payable annually in arrears\\non\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 , commencing\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 , 2021 (each an “Interest Payment\\nDate”). Interest payable on an Interest Payment Date will be paid to the persons in whose names the Notes are registered at the close of business on the regular record date; provided, however, that interest payable at the Stated Maturity Date\\nor earlier redemption date will be payable to the person to whom principal shall be payable. The regular record date for the Notes will be the fifteenth calendar day, whether or not a Business Day, immediately preceding the related Interest Payment\\nDate. Interest payable on an Interest Payment Date will be computed on the basis of an Actual/Actual (ICMA) (as defined in the rulebook of the International Capital Market Association) day count convention. If any Interest Payment Date, the Stated Maturity Date or earlier redemption date falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the related\\npayment of principal, premium, if any, or interest and Additional Amounts, if any, will be made on the next succeeding Business Day as if made on the date the applicable payment was due, and no interest will accrue on the amount so payable for the\\nperiod from and after such Interest Payment Date, the Stated Maturity Date or such redemption date, as the case may be, to the date of such payment on the next succeeding Business Day. For purposes of the Notes, “Business Day” means any\\nday, other than a Saturday or Sunday, which is not a day on which banking institutions in The City of New York or London are authorized or required by law, regulation or executive order to close. Issuance of the Notes in Sterling Initial holders will be required to pay for the Notes in Sterling, and principal, premium, if any, and interest payments in respect of the\\nNotes, including any payments made upon any redemption of the Notes, will be payable in Sterling. If Sterling is not available in our\\ngood faith judgment for the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest with respect to the Notes, including payments of redemption on the Notes, due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond the control of AHFC, or\\nis no longer used by the United Kingdom or for the settlement of transactions by public institutions of or within the international banking community, AHFC will be entitled to satisfy its obligations to holders of the Notes by making that payment in\\nU.S. dollars on the basis of the Market Exchange Rate (as defined below) as computed by the exchange rate agent on the second Business Day before that payment is due, or if such Market Exchange Rate is not then available, on the basis of the most\\nrecently available Market Exchange Rate on or before the date that payment is due or as otherwise determined by AHFC in good faith, if the foregoing is impracticable. Any payment in respect of the Notes so made in U.S. dollars will not constitute a\\ndefault under the Indenture. Neither the Trustee nor the PS-9 \\nPaying Agent shall be responsible for obtaining exchange rates, effecting conversions or otherwise handling redenominations. The “Market Exchange Rate” means the noon buying rate in The City of New York for cable transfers of Sterling as certified for\\ncustoms purposes (or, if not so certified, as otherwise determined) by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. In the event that Sterling,\\nor an official redenomination of Sterling, is no longer used by the United Kingdom, AHFC’s obligations with respect to payments on the Notes shall, in each case, be regarded immediately following such redenomination as providing for the payment\\nof that amount of Sterling representing the amount of such obligations immediately before such redenomination. The Notes do not provide for any adjustment to any amount payable under the Notes as a result of any change in the value of Sterling\\nrelative to any other currency due solely to fluctuations in exchange rates. All determinations referred to above made by the exchange\\nrate agent will be at its sole discretion and will, in the absence of clear error, be conclusive for all purposes and binding on the holders of the Notes. Further Issuances We may, from time to\\ntime, without notice to or the consent of the holders of the Notes, create and issue additional notes, having the same ranking, interest rate, Stated Maturity Date, redemption provisions and other terms as the Notes, as applicable, except for\\n(1)\\xa0the original issue date, (2)\\xa0the issue price and (3)\\xa0in some cases, the first interest payment date; provided, however, such additional notes must be fungible with the previously issued notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\\nAdditional notes will be considered part of the same series of notes as the Notes and any of our other Medium-Term Notes, Series A previously issued or issued in the future. We also may, from time to time, without notice to or the consent of the\\nholders of the Notes, create and issue additional debt securities, under the Indenture or otherwise, ranking equally with the Notes and our other Medium-Term Notes, Series A. Optional Redemption The Notes will be\\nredeemable before their maturity, in whole or in part, at our option, at any time, at a “make-whole” redemption price in cash equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed and (ii)\\xa0the sum of the\\npresent values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal of and interest on the Notes to be redeemed (exclusive of interest accrued to but excluding the redemption date) discounted to the redemption date on an annual basis (based on an\\nActual/Actual (ICMA) (as defined in the rulebook of International Capital Market Association) day count convention) at the applicable Comparable Government Bond Rate plus basis points, plus, in each of clause (i)\\xa0and (ii), unpaid interest, if\\nany, thereon accrued to but excluding the redemption date. The following definitions will apply with respect to the foregoing: “Comparable Government Bond” means, in relation to any Comparable Government Bond Rate calculation, at the discretion of an\\nIndependent Investment Banker, a United Kingdom government bond whose maturity is closest to the maturity of the Notes to be redeemed, or if the Independent Investment Banker in its discretion determines that such similar bond is not in issue, such\\nother United Kingdom government bond as such Independent Investment Banker may, with the advice of three brokers of, and/or market makers in, United Kingdom government bonds selected by such Independent Investment Banker, determine to be appropriate\\nfor determining the Comparable Government Bond Rate;. “Comparable Government Bond Rate” means the price, expressed as a\\npercentage (rounded to three decimal places, with 0.0005 being rounded upwards), at which the gross redemption yield on the Notes to be redeemed, if they were to be purchased at such price on the third Business Day prior to the date fixed for\\nredemption, would be equal to the gross redemption yield on such Business Day of the Comparable Government Bond on the basis of the middle market price of the Comparable Government Bond prevailing at 11:00 a.m. (London time) on such Business Day as\\ndetermined by an Independent Investment Banker. PS-10 “Independent Investment Banker” means each of Barclays Bank PLC, BNP Paribas,\\nDeutsche Bank AG, London Branch, and Société Générale and their respective successors, or, if such firm is unwilling or unable to select the Comparable Government Bond, an independent investment banking institution of\\ninternational standing appointed by AHFC. Notice of any redemption will be given in writing not more than 60 nor less than 30 days before\\nthe redemption date to each holder of the Notes to be redeemed. Such notice of redemption shall specify the principal amount of Notes to be redeemed, ISIN and Common Code numbers of the Notes to be redeemed, the redemption date, the redemption\\nprice, the place or places of payment and that payment will be made upon presentation and surrender of such Notes. Unless we default in payment of the redemption price, on and after the redemption date interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or\\nportions thereof called for redemption. If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed, the Trustee will select Notes to be redeemed,\\nwhich, in the case of Notes in book-entry form, will be in accordance with the procedures of the applicable depositary. The Trustee may select the Notes and portions of the Notes in amounts of £100,000 and integral multiples of £1,000 in\\nexcess thereof. Payment of Additional Amounts We will, subject to the exceptions and limitations set forth below, pay as additional interest such Additional Amounts as are necessary in\\norder that the net amount of such payment of the principal of and interest on a Note to a holder who is a United States Alien (as such term is defined below), after deduction for any present or future tax, assessment or governmental charge of the\\nUnited States (as such term is defined below), or a political subdivision or authority thereof or therein, imposed by withholding with respect to the payment, will not be less than the amount provided for in such Note to be then due and payable.\\nHowever, the foregoing obligation to pay Additional Amounts shall not apply: \\n\\n(a)\\n to any tax, assessment or governmental charge that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any\\npresent or former connection between such holder (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder of, or holder of power over, such holder, if such holder is an estate, trust, partnership or corporation) and the United States,\\nincluding, without limitation, such holder (or such fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member, shareholder or holder of a power) being considered as: \\n\\n(i)\\n being or having been present or engaged in a trade or business in the United States or having had a permanent\\nestablishment therein; \\n\\n(ii)\\n having a current or former relationship with the United States, including a relationship as a citizen or\\nresident or being treated as a resident thereof; or \\n\\n(iii)\\n being or having been, for United States federal income tax purposes, a personal holding company, a\\n“controlled foreign corporation”, a “passive foreign investment company” (including a qualified electing fund), a corporation that has accumulated earnings to avoid United States federal income tax or a private foundation or\\nother tax-exempt organization; \\n\\n(b)\\n to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed by reason of the holder (i)\\xa0owning or having\\nowned, directly or indirectly, actually or constructively, 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of AHFC entitled to vote, (ii)\\xa0receiving interest described in Section\\xa0881(c)(3)(A) of the United States\\nInternal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), or (iii)\\xa0being a controlled foreign corporation with respect to the United States that is related to AHFC by actual or constructive stock ownership; \\n\\n(c)\\n to any holder that is a fiduciary or partnership or other than the sole beneficial owner of the Note, but only\\nto the extent that a beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary or member of such partnership or a beneficial owner of the Note would not have been entitled to the payment of such Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settlor, member\\nor beneficial owner been the holder of such Note; PS-11 \\n\\n(d)\\n to any tax, assessment or governmental charge that would not have been imposed or withheld but for the failure\\nof the holder or any other person to comply with certification, identification or information reporting requirements under United States income tax laws, without regard to any tax treaty, with respect to the payment, concerning the nationality,\\nresidence, identity or connection with the United States of the holder or a beneficial owner of such Note, if such compliance is required by United States income tax laws, without regard to any tax treaty, as a precondition to relief or exemption\\nfrom such tax, assessment or governmental charge; \\n\\n(e)\\n to any tax, assessment or governmental charge that is imposed otherwise than by withholding by us or a paying\\nagent from the payment; \\n\\n(f)\\n to any tax, assessment or governmental charge that would not have been so imposed or withheld but for the\\npresentation by the holder of such Note for payment on a date more than 15 days after the date on which such payment became due and payable or the date on which payment thereof is duly provided for, whichever occurs later; \\n\\n(g)\\n to any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, excise, wealth or personal property tax or any similar tax,\\nassessment or governmental charge; \\n\\n(h)\\n to any withholding or deduction that is imposed on a payment to an individual and that is required to be made\\npursuant to any law implementing or complying with, or introduced to conform to, any European Union Directive on the taxation of savings; \\n\\n(i)\\n to any tax, assessment or governmental charge that is payable otherwise than by withholding by AHFC or the\\nPaying Agent from the payment of the principal of or interest on such Note; \\n\\n(j)\\n to any tax, assessment or governmental charge required to be withheld by any Paying Agent from such payment of\\nprincipal of or interest on any Note, if such payment can be made without such withholding by any other Paying Agent; \\n\\n(k)\\n to any withholding or deduction on or in respect of any Note pursuant to sections 1471 through 1474 of the\\nCode, and the regulations, administrative guidance and official interpretations promulgated thereunder (“FATCA”), any agreement entered into pursuant to Section\\xa01471(b)(1) of the Code, or any fiscal or regulatory legislation, rules or\\npractices adopted pursuant to any intergovernmental agreement entered into in connection with the implementation of FATCA; or \\n\\n(l)\\n to any tax imposed as a result of any combination of the above. The term “United States” means the United States of America, the States thereof (including the District of Columbia) and any other\\npolitical subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein affecting taxation, and the term “United States Alien” means any corporation, partnership, individual or fiduciary that, as to the United States, is for United States federal\\nincome tax purposes (A)\\xa0a foreign corporation, (B)\\xa0a foreign partnership one or more of the members of which is, for United States federal income tax purposes, a foreign corporation, a non-resident\\nalien individual or a non-resident alien fiduciary of a foreign estate or trust, (C)\\xa0a non-resident alien individual, or (D)\\xa0a\\nnon-resident alien fiduciary of a foreign estate or trust. Redemption for Tax Reasons If we have or will become obliged to pay Additional Amounts (as described above under the heading “—Payment of Additional\\nAmounts”) as a result of any change in, or amendment to, the laws or regulations of the United States or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein affecting taxation, or any change in official position regarding the\\napplication or interpretation of such laws, regulations or rulings, which change or amendment becomes effective on or after the Settlement Date, and we determine that such obligation cannot be avoided by the use of reasonable measures then available\\nto us, we may, at our option, at any time, having given not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ prior written notice to Holders, redeem, in whole, but not in part, the Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of their principal amount,\\ntogether with unpaid interest, if PS-12 \\nany, on the Notes to be redeemed accrued to but excluding the redemption date, provided that no such notice of redemption shall be given earlier than 90 days prior to the earliest date on which\\nwe would be obliged to pay such Additional Amounts if a payment in respect to the Notes were due on such date. Prior to the transmission or publication of any notice of redemption pursuant to this paragraph, we shall deliver to the Trustee a\\ncertificate signed by two directors of AHFC stating that we are entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to our right to so redeem the Notes has occurred. Modification of the Indenture See\\n“Description of Debt Securities—Modification, Waivers and Meetings” in the accompanying prospectus. Events of Default, Notice and\\nWaiver See “Description of Debt Securities—Events of Default” in the accompanying prospectus. Discharge, Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance The defeasance provisions described in the accompanying prospectus under “Description of Debt Securities—Discharge, Legal Defeasance\\nand Covenant Defeasance” will be applicable to the Notes. Governing Law The Indenture is governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, and, once issued, the Notes will be as well.\\nBook-Entry Delivery and Settlement We have obtained the information in this section concerning Clearstream and Euroclear and their book-entry systems and procedures from sources\\nthat we believe to be reliable. We take no responsibility for an accurate portrayal of this information. In addition, the description of the clearing systems in this section reflects our understanding of the rules and procedures of Clearstream and\\nEuroclear as they are currently in effect. Those systems could change their rules and procedures at any time. Global Clearance and Settlement\\nThe Notes will be issued in the form of one or more global notes in fully registered form, without coupons, and will be deposited\\nwith, or on behalf of, a common depositary for, and in respect of interests held through, Euroclear and Clearstream. Except as described herein, certificates will not be issued in exchange for beneficial interests in the global notes. Except as set forth below, the global notes may be transferred, in whole and not in part, only to the common depositary, its successors or\\ntheir respective nominees. Beneficial interests in the global notes will be represented, and transfers of such beneficial interests will\\nbe effected, through accounts of financial institutions acting on behalf of beneficial owners as direct or indirect participants in Euroclear or Clearstream. Those beneficial interests will be in denominations of £100,000 and integral\\nmultiples of £1,000 in excess thereof. Investors may hold Notes directly through Euroclear or Clearstream, if they are participants in such systems, or indirectly through organizations that are participants in such systems. Owners of beneficial interests in the global notes will not be entitled to have Notes registered in their names, and, except as described\\nherein, will not receive or be entitled to receive physical delivery of Notes in definitive PS-13 \\nform. So long as the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream or such common depositary’s nominee is the registered holder of the global notes, the common depositary or such nominee,\\nas the case may be, will be considered the sole holder of the Notes represented by the global notes for all purposes under the Indenture and the global notes. Except as provided below, beneficial owners will not be considered the owners or holders\\nof the Notes under the Indenture, including for purposes of receiving any reports delivered by us or the Trustee pursuant to the Indenture. Accordingly, each beneficial owner must rely on the procedures of the clearing systems and, if such person is\\nnot a participant of the clearing systems, on the procedures of the participant through which such person owns its interest, to exercise any rights of a holder under the Indenture. Under existing industry practices, if we request any action of\\nholders or a beneficial owner desires to give or take any action which a holder is entitled to give or take under the Indenture, the clearing systems would authorize their participants holding the relevant beneficial interests to give or take action\\nand the participants would authorize beneficial owners owning through the participants to give or take such action or would otherwise act upon the instructions of beneficial owners. Conveyance of notices and other communications by the clearing\\nsystems to their participants, by the participants to indirect participants and by the participants and indirect participants to beneficial owners will be governed by arrangements among them, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as\\nmay be in effect from time to time. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive form. These limits and laws may impair the ability to transfer beneficial\\ninterests in global notes. Clearstream Clearstream has advised that it is incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg and licensed as a bank and professional depositary. Clearstream\\nholds securities for its participating organizations and facilitates the clearance and settlement of securities transactions among its participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of its participants, thereby eliminating the need\\nfor physical movement of certificates. Clearstream provides to its participants, among other things, services for safekeeping, administration, clearance and settlement of internationally traded securities and securities lending and borrowing.\\nClearstream interfaces with domestic markets in several countries. Clearstream has established an electronic bridge with the Euroclear Operator (as defined below) to facilitate the settlement of trades between Clearstream and Euroclear. As a\\nregistered bank in Luxembourg, Clearstream is subject to regulation by the Luxembourg Commission for the Supervision of the Financial Sector. Clearstream customers are recognized financial institutions around the world, including underwriters,\\nsecurities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations and may include the Underwriters. Indirect access to Clearstream is also available to others, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust\\ncompanies that clear through, or maintain a custodial relationship with, a Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly. Distributions with respect to Notes held beneficially through Clearstream will be credited to cash accounts of Clearstream participants in\\naccordance with its rules and procedures. Euroclear Euroclear has advised that it was created in 1968 to hold securities for its participants and to clear and settle transactions between\\nEuroclear participants through simultaneous electronic book-entry delivery against payment, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of certificates and any risk from lack of simultaneous transfers of securities and cash. Euroclear\\nincludes various other services, including securities lending and borrowing and interfaces with domestic markets in several countries. Euroclear is operated by Euroclear Bank SA/NV (the “Euroclear Operator”). All operations are conducted\\nby the Euroclear Operator, and all Euroclear securities clearance accounts and Euroclear cash accounts are accounts with the Euroclear Operator. Euroclear participants include banks (including central banks), securities brokers and dealers and other\\nprofessional financial intermediaries and may include the Underwriters. Indirect access to Euroclear is also available to other firms that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear participant, either directly or\\nindirectly. PS-14 Securities clearance accounts and cash accounts with the Euroclear Operator are governed by\\nthe Terms and Conditions Governing Use of Euroclear and the related operating procedures of Euroclear, and applicable Belgian law (collectively, the “Terms and Conditions”). The Terms and Conditions govern transfers of securities and cash\\nwithin Euroclear, withdrawals of securities and cash from Euroclear, and receipts of payments with respect to securities in Euroclear. All securities in Euroclear are held on a fungible basis without attribution of specific certificates to specific\\nsecurities clearance accounts. The Euroclear Operator acts under the Terms and Conditions only on behalf of Euroclear participants, and has no records of or relationship with persons holding through Euroclear participants. Distributions with respect to the Notes held beneficially through Euroclear will be credited to the cash accounts of Euroclear participants in\\naccordance with the Terms and Conditions. Euroclear and Clearstream Arrangements So long as the common depositary for Euroclear or Clearstream or such common depositary’s nominee is the registered holder of the global\\nnotes, the common depositary or such nominee, as the case may be, will be considered the sole owner or holder of the Notes represented by such global notes for all purposes under the Indenture and the Notes. Payments of principal, interest and\\nAdditional Amounts, if any, in respect of the global notes will be made to the common depositary or such common depositary’s nominee, as the case may be, as registered holder thereof. None of us, the Trustee, any agent and any affiliate of any\\nof the above or any person by whom any of the above is controlled (as such term is defined in the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the “Securities Act”) will have any responsibility or liability for any records relating to or\\npayments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in the global notes or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests. Distributions of principal, premium, if any, and interest with respect to the global notes, including any payments made upon any redemption of\\nthe global notes, will be credited in Sterling to the extent received by Euroclear or Clearstream from the Paying Agent to the cash accounts of Euroclear or Clearstream customers in accordance with the relevant system’s rules and procedures.\\nBecause Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants, the ability\\nof a person having an interest in the global notes to pledge such interest to persons or entities which do not participate in the relevant clearing system, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be affected by the lack of a\\nphysical certificate in respect of such interest. Initial Settlement We understand that investors that hold their Notes through Clearstream or Euroclear accounts will follow the settlement procedures that are\\napplicable to conventional eurobonds in registered form. Subject to applicable procedures of Clearstream and Euroclear, Notes will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Clearstream and Euroclear participants on the business day following\\nthe settlement date, for value on the settlement date. Secondary Market Trading Because the purchaser determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of trading of any Notes where both the\\npurchaser’s and seller’s accounts are located to ensure that settlement can be made on the desired value date. We understand\\nthat secondary market trading between Clearstream and/or Euroclear participants will occur in the ordinary way following the applicable rules and operating procedures of Clearstream and Euroclear. Secondary market trading will be settled using\\nprocedures applicable to conventional eurobonds in registered form. PS-15 You should be aware that investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries,\\npayments and other communications involving the Notes through Clearstream and Euroclear on days when those systems are open for business. Those systems may not be open for business on days when banks, brokers and other institutions are open for\\nbusiness in the United States. In addition, because of time-zone differences, there may be problems with completing transactions\\ninvolving Clearstream and Euroclear on the same business day as in the United States. U.S.\\xa0investors who wish to transfer their interests in the Notes, or to make or receive a payment or delivery of the Notes, on a particular day, may find that\\nthe transactions will not be performed until the next business day in Luxembourg or Brussels, depending on whether Clearstream or Euroclear is used. Clearstream or Euroclear will credit payments to the cash accounts of Clearstream customers or Euroclear participants, as applicable, in\\naccordance with the relevant system’s rules and procedures, to the extent received by its depositary. Clearstream or the Euroclear Operator, as the case may be, will take any other action permitted to be taken by a holder under the Indenture on\\nbehalf of a Clearstream customer or Euroclear participant only in accordance with its relevant rules and procedures. Clearstream and\\nEuroclear have agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of the Notes among participants of Clearstream and Euroclear. However, they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform those procedures, and they may\\ndiscontinue those procedures at any time. Exchange of Global Notes for Certificated Notes Subject to certain conditions, the Notes represented by the global notes are exchangeable for notes in definitive form of like tenor in minimum\\ndenominations of £100,000 principal amount and multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof if: \\n\\n(1)\\n Clearstream, Euroclear or any successor thereto notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to act as a clearing\\nsystem for the Notes; \\n\\n(2)\\n we, at our option, notify the Trustee in writing that we elect to cause the issuance of certificated notes with\\nrespect to the Notes; or \\n\\n(3)\\n there has occurred and is continuing an event of default with respect to the Notes. In all cases, definitive notes delivered in exchange for any global note or beneficial interest therein will be registered in the names, and\\nissued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of the common depositary (in accordance with its customary procedures). Payments (including principal, premium, if any, and interest) and transfers with respect to notes in definitive form may be executed at the\\noffice or agency maintained for such purpose, at our option, by check mailed to the holders thereof at the respective addresses set forth in the register of holders of the Notes, provided that all payments (including principal, premium, if any, and\\ninterest) with respect to notes in definitive form, for which the holders thereof have given wire transfer instructions, will be required to be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the holders thereof. No\\nservice charge will be made for any registration of transfer, but payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or governmental charge payable in connection with that registration may be required. PS-16 UNDERWRITING Under the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in a terms agreement dated\\nNovember\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0, 2020 (the “Terms Agreement”), between us and the underwriters named below (the “Underwriters”), incorporating the terms of\\na distribution agreement, dated August\\xa08, 2019, between us and the agents named in the prospectus supplement, we have agreed to sell to the Underwriters, and the Underwriters have severally and not jointly agreed to purchase, as principal, the\\nprincipal amount of the Notes set forth below opposite their names. \\n\\n Underwriters\\nAggregate\\xa0PrincipalAmount of Notes\\n\\n\\n Barclays Bank PLC.\\n£\\n\\n\\n BNP Paribas\\n\\n\\n Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch\\n\\n\\n Société Générale\\n\\n\\n Total\\n£\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nThe Notes are a new issue of securities for which no established trading market exists. Although we intend to\\napply to list the Notes on the New York Stock Exchange, no assurance can be given that we will be able to list the Notes. Even if the Notes are listed, no assurance can be given that an active trading market for the Notes will develop or be\\nmaintained. If an active trading market does not develop or is not maintained for the Notes, Noteholders may not be able to resell them at all or at prices acceptable to them. The Underwriters may from time to time make a market in the Notes but are\\nnot obligated to do so and may cease at any time. Neither we nor the Underwriters can assure you that any trading market for the Notes will develop, continue or be liquid. The Notes sold by the Underwriters to the public will initially be offered at the public offering price set forth on the cover page of this\\npricing supplement. After the Notes are released for sale, the Underwriters may change the offering price and the other selling terms. The Underwriters are offering the Notes, subject to prior sale, when, as and if issued to and accepted by them,\\nsubject to approval of legal matters by their counsel and other conditions contained in the Terms Agreement, such as the receipt by the Underwriters of officers’ certificates and legal opinions. The Underwriters reserve the right to withdraw,\\ncancel or modify offers to the public and to reject orders in whole or in part. We have agreed to provide the Underwriters an\\nunderwriting discount of\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0% of the principal amount of the Notes in connection with this offering. The expenses of this offering, not including the underwriting discount, are estimated at approximately\\n$\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0and are payable by us. In connection with this offering,\\nBarclays Bank PLC, on behalf of the Underwriters, is permitted to engage in certain transactions that stabilize the price of the Notes. These transactions may consist of bids or purchases for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price\\nof the Notes. If the Underwriters create a short position in the Notes in connection with this offering by selling more Notes than they have purchased from us, then the Underwriters may reduce that short position by purchasing Notes in the open\\nmarket. In general, purchases of Notes for the purpose of stabilization or to reduce a short position may cause the price of the Notes to be higher than in the absence of these purchases. The Underwriters are not required to engage in these\\nactivities, and may end any of these activities at any time. Neither we nor any of the Underwriters make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of\\nthe Notes. It is expected that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefor on or about November\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0,\\n2020, which will be the third U.S. business day following the date of the pricing of the Notes. Under Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, trades in the secondary market\\ngenerally are required PS-17 \\nto settle in two U.S. business days, unless the parties to a trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on any date prior to the two U.S. business days\\nbefore the original issue date will be required to specify alternative settlement arrangements to prevent a failed settlement. We may\\nenter into hedging transactions in connection with the issuance of the Notes, including forwards, futures, options, interest rate or exchange rate swaps and repurchase or reverse repurchase transactions with, or arranged by, any of the Underwriters\\nor an affiliate of that Underwriter. The applicable Underwriter and its affiliates may receive compensation, trading gain or other benefits in connection with these hedging transactions and the hedging transactions described below. The Underwriters and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include\\nsecurities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. Certain of the Underwriters and their respective affiliates\\nhave, from time to time, performed, and may in the future perform, various financial advisory and investment banking services for AHFC and its subsidiaries, for which they received or will receive customary fees and expenses. In addition, certain\\naffiliates of the Underwriters are or have been lenders under AHFC’s and its subsidiaries’ credit facilities and term loans, for which they have received or will receive fees under agreements they have entered into with AHFC or its\\nsubsidiaries. Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, an affiliate of Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, is the trustee under the Indenture governing the Notes and the paying agent, registrar and transfer agent for the Notes offered hereby. In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the Underwriters and their respective affiliates may make or hold a broad array\\nof investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers, and such investment and securities\\nactivities may involve securities and/or instruments of AHFC or its subsidiaries. If any of the Underwriters or their affiliates have a lending relationship with AHFC or its subsidiaries, certain of those Underwriters or their affiliates routinely\\nhedge, and certain other of those Underwriters or their affiliates may hedge, their credit exposure to AHFC or its subsidiaries consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, these Underwriters and their affiliates would hedge\\nsuch exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in AHFC’s or its subsidiaries’ securities, including potentially the Notes offered hereby. Any such\\ncredit default swaps or short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes offered hereby. The Underwriters and their respective affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent\\nresearch views in respect of such securities or instruments and may at any time hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments. To the extent any Underwriter that is not a U.S. registered broker-dealer intends to effect sales of Notes in the United States, it will do so\\nthrough one or more U.S. registered broker-dealers or otherwise in accordance with the applicable U.S. securities laws and regulations. AHFC has agreed to indemnify the several Underwriters against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, or to\\ncontribute to payments the Underwriters may be required to make in respect of these liabilities. Prohibition of Sales to EEA and UK Retail Investors\\nThe Notes may not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA or in the United Kingdom. For the\\npurposes of this provision, the expression “retail investor” means a person who is one (or more) of the following: \\n\\n(a)\\n a retail client as defined in point (11)\\xa0of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or PS-18 \\n\\n(b)\\n a customer within the meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as\\na professional client as defined in point (10)\\xa0of Article 4(1) of MiFID II. United Kingdom Any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of Section\\xa021 of the FSMA) in connection with the issue\\nor sale of the Notes may only be communicated or caused to be communicated in circumstances in which Section\\xa021(1) of the FSMA does not apply to AHFC. All applicable provisions of the FSMA must be complied with in respect to anything done by any person in relation to the Notes in, from or\\notherwise involving the United Kingdom. PS-19 LEGAL MATTERS In the opinion of David Peim, as counsel to AHFC, when the Notes offered by this pricing supplement and accompanying prospectus supplement and\\nprospectus have been executed and issued by AHFC and authenticated by the Trustee pursuant to the Indenture, and delivered against payment as contemplated herein, such Notes will be legally valid and binding obligations of AHFC, enforceable against\\nAHFC in accordance with their terms, except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws relating to or affecting creditors’ rights generally (including, without limitation, fraudulent conveyance\\nlaws), and by general principles of equity, including, without limitation, concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing and the possible unavailability of specific performance or injunctive relief, regardless of whether\\nconsidered in a proceeding at law or in equity. This opinion is given as of the date hereof and is limited to the present laws of the State of California and the State of New York. In addition, this opinion is subject to customary assumptions about\\nthe Trustee’s authorization, execution and delivery of the Indenture and its authentication of the Notes and the enforceability of the Indenture with respect to the Trustee and other matters, all as stated in the letter of such counsel dated\\nAugust\\xa08, 2019 and filed as Exhibit 5.1 to AHFC’s Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No.\\xa0333-233119) filed with the Securities and Exchange\\nCommission on August\\xa08, 2019. Certain legal matters in connection with this offering will be passed upon for us by\\nO’Melveny\\xa0 Myers LLP. Sidley Austin LLP, New York, New York and London, United Kingdom, will act as counsel to the Underwriters in this offering. Sidley Austin LLP from time to time represents AHFC in connection with certain legal\\nmatters. PS-20 Investing in our Ordinary Shares involves substantial risks and uncertainties. In addition to other information in this prospectus\\nsupplement, you should carefully consider the following risks, the risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December\\xa031, 2019 and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September\\xa030, 2020, as well as the other information and data set forth in this prospectus supplement, the accompanying prospectus and the documents incorporated by reference herein\\nand therein before making an investment decision with respect to our Ordinary Shares. You should consider carefully and consult with your tax, legal and investment advisors with regard to the risks and uncertainties described below, together with\\nall of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes, before deciding to purchase our Ordinary Shares.\\nAny of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and prospects. The market price of our Ordinary Shares could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all\\nor part of your investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and\\nprospects. Some statements in this prospectus supplement, including statements in the following risk factors, constitute forward-looking statements. See “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.” Risks Related to Our Business The effects of the\\xa0ongoing\\xa0COVID-19\\xa0pandemic are having a significant material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and prospects, and if the pandemic is long-lasting\\nthese effects will become increasingly severe. The outbreak of the\\ncoronavirus\\xa0(COVID-19)\\xa0pandemic has led governments and other authorities around the world to impose measures intended to control its spread, including restrictions on freedom of movement and\\nbusiness operations such as travel bans, border closings, business closures, quarantines and\\xa0shelter-in-place\\xa0orders. As a result, the pandemic has\\nsignificantly\\xa0disrupted global travel, and has adversely impacted global commercial activity across the travel, lodging and hospitality industries. The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and is expected to\\ncontinue to have, significant adverse impacts on economic and market conditions and has resulted in a global economic contraction. The\\neffects of\\xa0the\\xa0COVID-19\\xa0pandemic on the hospitality industry are unprecedented with global demand for lodging drastically reduced and occupancy levels reaching historic lows. Due to the rapid\\nand broad spread of the virus and in response to related governmental restrictions and advisories, reductions in scheduled airline services and potential health risks to our employees and guests, we temporarily suspended operations at all of our\\nresorts in late March 2020. Our resorts began reopening in July, in stages, based on incremental easing of government restrictions and advisories and increases in scheduled commercial airline service. As a result of the suspension of operations at\\nall of our resorts, we had no revenues from resort operations in the second quarter of 2020. As of November\\xa013, 2020, 17 out of our 21 resorts had reopened and we anticipate opening most of the remaining resorts during the fourth quarter of\\n2020. However, we have experienced severely reduced occupancy at the resorts that have reopened due to the effects of the pandemic. We cannot predict when the effects of the pandemic will subside, or if there will be a resurgence of the virus, and\\nthus we cannot predict whether our opened resorts will be permitted to remain open or when our business at opened resorts will return to normalized or even break-even levels. The longer and more severe the pandemic, and if there are repeat or\\ncyclical outbreaks of the COVID-19 virus beyond the one being currently experienced, the greater the material adverse effect will be on our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations,\\nprospects and access to equity and credit markets and ability to service our indebtedness. There also can be no guarantee that when the\\neffects of the pandemic subside the demand for lodging, and consumer confidence in travel generally, will recover as quickly and fully as other industries. Additionally, the effects of the pandemic have had, and we expect will continue to have, a\\nmaterial adverse effect on our ability to consummate acquisitions and dispositions of resorts and our ability to timely complete planned capital expenditures and other projects. Additional risks to our business relating to the\\xa0COVID-19\\xa0pandemic include the following:\\n\\n\\n•\\n We have substantial debt outstanding currently, and our ongoing ability to service our significant financial\\nobligations depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow from operations. Our cash flow from operations has been materially reduced as a result of the temporary suspension of operations and reduced occupancy at our resorts and will\\ncontinue to be materially reduced as long as operations at some of our resorts remain suspended or opened resorts are operating at well-below historical levels. We cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations, that\\nfuture borrowings will be available to us under our revolving credit facility or otherwise, or that we will be able to complete any necessary financings or refinancings, in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay our debts and other obligations and\\nfund our other liquidity needs; \\n\\n•\\n The agreements which govern our various debt obligations impose restrictions on our business, including certain\\ncovenants under our revolving credit facility which currently prevent additional draws on the facility and may materially impact our liquidity and financial condition and could require us to seek to meet capital needs through asset sales or dilutive\\nequity sales; \\n\\n•\\n Adverse changes in our credit and any ratings could have an adverse impact on our interest expense;\\n\\n\\n•\\n Commercial airline service has been reduced or suspended to many of the regions in which our resorts are located.\\nIf scheduled airline service does not increase or return to normal levels once our resorts are\\xa0re-opened\\xa0it could have a material adverse effect on our resort revenues; \\n\\n•\\n Safety protocols established by certain jurisdictions in which our resorts are located, for example, Jamaica,\\nhave made travel to our resorts in those jurisdictions more challenging and less attractive, adversely affecting demand at those resorts; \\n\\n•\\n The economic fallout from the effects of the pandemic on the regions in which our resorts are located could\\nresult in increases in crime, theft, vandalism and other safety and health concerns in these areas that could directly impact our resorts or could result in the perception of such risks among prospective guests, which could lead to decreased future\\ndemand for our resorts; \\n\\n•\\n We have been and may continue to be required to recognize significant\\nnon-cash impairment charges as a result of material reductions in our cash flows from operations; \\n\\n•\\n We may be subject to increased risks related to employee matters, including increased employment litigation and\\nclaims for severance or other benefits tied to terminations or furloughs as a result of the suspension of operations at our resorts prompted by the effects of the pandemic; \\n\\n•\\n We have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs related to sanitation and hygiene requirements,\\nsocial distancing and other mitigation measures; \\n\\n•\\n Steps to reduce costs may negatively impact our reputation and guest loyalty, and future demand at our resorts\\nmay suffer as a result; \\n\\n•\\n We may experience disruptions as a result of corporate employees working remotely, including risk of\\ncybersecurity incidents and disruptions to internal control procedures; and \\n\\n•\\n In order to raise additional capital to fund our operations and service our indebtedness, we have sold assets and\\nissued equity securities and we may need to sell further assets or issue additional equity securities in the future at prices that are below the value of those assets or that may be dilutive to existing shareholders and that may be below what we\\nbelieve to be the intrinsic value of our Ordinary Shares. Risks Related to this Offering The per share trading price and trading volume of our Ordinary Shares may be volatile following this offering. The per share trading price of our Ordinary Shares has in the past and may continue to be volatile. In addition, the trading volume in our\\nOrdinary Shares may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. If the per share trading price of our Ordinary Shares declines significantly, you may be unable to resell your shares at or above the purchase price. We cannot assure you\\nthat the per share trading price of our Ordinary Shares will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future. Some of the factors\\nthat could negatively affect our share price or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our Ordinary Shares include: \\n\\n•\\n the realization of any of the risk factors presented in this prospectus supplement and in our SEC filings;\\n\\n\\n•\\n actual or anticipated differences in our estimates, or in the estimates of analysts, for our revenues, Adjusted\\nEBITDA, results of operations, level of indebtedness, liquidity or financial condition; \\n\\n•\\n inability to raise capital in sufficient amounts when needed; \\n\\n•\\n additions and departures of key personnel; \\n\\n•\\n failure to comply with the requirements of the Nasdaq Global Select Market; \\n\\n•\\n failure to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or other laws or regulations; \\n\\n•\\n future issuances, sales or resales, or anticipated issuances, sales or resales, of our Ordinary Shares;\\n\\n\\n•\\n publication of research reports about us, our resorts, the all-inclusive\\nsegment of the lodging industry or the lodging industry generally; \\n\\n•\\n the performance and market valuations of other similar companies; \\n\\n•\\n broad disruptions in the financial markets, including sudden disruptions in the equity or credit markets;\\n\\n\\n•\\n speculation in the press or investment community; \\n\\n•\\n actual, potential or perceived control, accounting or reporting problems; \\n\\n•\\n changes in accounting principles, policies and guidelines; \\n\\n•\\n general economic and financial market conditions; and \\n\\n•\\n persistence or expansion of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the\\nhospitality industry. In the past, securities class-action litigation has often been instituted against companies\\nfollowing periods of volatility in the market price of their shares. This type of litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on us. Future issuances of debt securities and equity securities may adversely affect us, including the market price of our Ordinary Shares and may be dilutive\\nto existing shareholders. Given the current materially adverse effects of the COVID-19\\npandemic on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, we continue to explore options to raise capital to fund our operations and service our indebtedness, including equity capital through a private placement or public\\noffering. We have issued equity securities recently and in order to address liquidity issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic may be required to issue additional equity securities in the future at prices that may be dilutive to existing shareholders\\nand that may be below what we believe to be the intrinsic value of our Ordinary Shares. In the future, we may also incur debt or issue\\nequity ranking senior to our Ordinary Shares. Those securities will generally have priority upon liquidation. Such securities also may be governed by an indenture or other instrument containing covenants restricting its operating flexibility.\\nAdditionally, any convertible or exchangeable securities that we issue in the future may have rights, preferences and privileges more favorable than those of our Ordinary Shares. Because our decision to issue debt or equity in the future will depend\\non market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing, nature or success of our future capital raising efforts. As a result, future capital raising efforts may reduce the market price of our\\nOrdinary Shares and be dilutive to existing shareholders. Dividends distributed by us, if any, on the Ordinary Shares to certain related parties in\\nlow-taxed jurisdictions might in the future become subject to an additional Dutch withholding tax on dividends. We have not paid a dividend to our ordinary shareholders in the past, and we may not pay such dividends in the future, especially under current\\nconditions, but if we ever do, then under current law, dividends paid on the Ordinary Shares are in principle subject to Dutch dividend withholding tax at a rate of 15% under the Dutch Dividend Withholding Tax Act, unless a domestic or treaty\\nexemption applies. In a letter to the Dutch parliament dated May\\xa029, 2020, the Dutch State Secretary of Finance announced that the government intends to introduce an additional withholding tax on dividends paid (i)\\xa0to group entities in\\njurisdictions that have a corporate income tax rate below 9%, (ii) to group entities in jurisdictions that are included on the EU’s blacklist of non-cooperative jurisdictions or (iii)\\xa0in certain\\nabusive situations, effective January\\xa01, 2024. On September\\xa025, 2020, the Dutch government launched an internet consultation to provide interested parties the opportunity to respond to the draft legislative proposal to introduce the\\nconditional withholding tax on dividends. Pursuant to the proposal published for consultation purposes, the conditional withholding tax on dividend payments will be implemented in the form of an amendment to the recently passed conditional\\nwithholding tax on interest and royalty payments pursuant to the Dutch Withholding Tax Act 2021 (Wet bronbelasting 2021), which act will become effective January\\xa01, 2021. The proposal published for consultation purposes stipulates that\\nthe rate will be equal to the highest Dutch corporate income tax rate (currently 25%) at the time of the dividend payment. At the same time, the current Dutch dividend withholding tax regime is anticipated to remain in place. However, if the\\ndividend withholding tax and the conditional withholding tax on dividends cumulate, the proposal published for consultation purposes stipulates that the conditional withholding tax will be reduced by the dividend withholding tax levied. As a result,\\nif the shareholder being a related entity (A)\\xa0is established or has a permanent establishment in a jurisdiction that has a corporate tax rate below 9% or in a jurisdiction included on the EU’s blacklist of\\nnon-cooperative jurisdictions, (B)\\xa0is a hybrid entity or a reverse hybrid entity or (C)\\xa0is interposed to avoid tax otherwise due by another entity, the tax rate on dividends distributed by us may\\nrise in the future from 15% to the highest corporate tax rate (currently 25%). The internet consultation closed on October\\xa023, 2020. After the internet consultation, the Dutch government aims to prepare the final legislative proposal in early\\n2021. Investing in our\\ncommon stock involves risk. Prior to making a decision about investing in our common stock, you should carefully consider the specific\\nfactors discussed below together with all of the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement.\\nYou should also consider the risks, uncertainties and assumptions discussed under the heading “Risk Factors” included\\nin our most recent annual report on Form 10-K which is on file with the SEC and is incorporated herein by reference, as revised\\nor supplemented by our subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q on file with the SEC and which may be amended, supplemented or\\nsuperseded from time to time by other reports we have subsequently filed or may file with the SEC in the future.Additional Risks Related to This\\nOfferingManagement will have broad discretion\\nas to the use of the proceeds from this offering, and may not use the proceeds effectively.Because we have not\\ndesignated the amount of net proceeds from this offering to be used for any particular purpose, our management will have broad\\ndiscretion as to the application of the net proceeds from this offering and could use them for purposes other than those contemplated\\nat the time of the offering. Our management may use the net proceeds for corporate purposes that may not improve our financial\\ncondition or market value. The failure by management to apply these funds effectively could result in financial losses that could\\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, cause the price of our common stock to decline and delay the development and commercialization\\nof our product candidates.You may experience immediate and substantial\\ndilution.The offering price\\nper share in this offering may exceed the net tangible book value per share of our common stock outstanding prior to this offering.\\nAssuming that an aggregate of 2,732,240 shares of our common stock are sold during the term of the sales agreement with B. Riley\\nSecurities and Needham  Company at a price of $9.15 per share, the last reported sale price of our common stock on the NYSE\\nAmerican on November 25, 2020, for aggregate gross proceeds of $25 million, after deducting commissions and estimated aggregate\\noffering expenses payable by us, you will experience immediate dilution of $7.43 per share, representing the difference between\\nour as-adjusted net tangible book value per share as of September 30, 2020, after giving effect to this offering and the assumed\\noffering price. The exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants may result in further dilution of your investment. Additionally,\\nbecause the sales of shares of our common stock offered hereby will be made directly into the market, the prices at which we sell\\nsuch securities will vary and these variations may be significant. As a result, you may suffer dilution if you purchase shares\\nin this offering at a higher price than other shares offered hereby are sold. See the section entitled “Dilution” below\\nfor a more detailed illustration of the dilution you would incur if you participate in this offering.You may experience\\nfuture dilution as a result of future equity offerings.We will need significant\\nadditional funds for obtaining regulatory approval and commercialization of Defencath™ in the United States. In order to\\nraise additional capital, we plan to offer in the future additional shares of our common stock or other securities convertible\\ninto or exchangeable for our common stock at prices that may not be the same as the price per share in this offering. We may sell\\nshares or other securities in any other offering at a price per share that is less than the price per share paid by investors in\\nthis offering, and investors purchasing shares or other securities in the future could have rights superior to existing stockholders.\\nThe price per share at which we sell additional shares of our common stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into common\\nstock, in future transactions may be higher or lower than the price per share paid by investors in this offering.USE\\nOF PROCEEDSWe intend to use the\\nnet proceeds of this offering for general corporate purposes, including obtaining regulatory approval and commercialization of\\nDefencath™ in the U.S., research and development, and working capital and capital expenditures.The amounts and\\ntiming of our use of the net proceeds from this offering will depend on a number of factors, such as the timing and progress\\nof our research and development efforts, the timing and progress of any collaborative or strategic partnering efforts, and\\nthe competitive environment for our planned products. As of the date of this prospectus supplement, we cannot specify with\\ncertainty all of the particular uses for the net proceeds to us from this offering. Accordingly, our management will have\\nbroad discretion in the timing and application of these proceeds. Pending application of the net proceeds as described above,\\nwe intend to temporarily invest a portion of the proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing instruments.DILUTIONOur net tangible book\\nvalue as of September 30, 2020 was approximately $34.5 million, or $1.10 per share of common stock. Net tangible book value per\\nshare is calculated by subtracting our total liabilities from our total tangible assets, which is total assets less intangible\\nassets, and dividing this amount by the number of shares of common stock outstanding. After giving effect to the sale by us of\\nthe full $25 million of common stock that may be offered in this offering at an assumed offering price of $9.15 per share, which\\nwas the closing price of our common stock on the NYSE American on November 25, 2020, and after deducting estimated offering commissions\\nand expenses payable by us, our as-adjusted net tangible book value as of September 30, 2020 would have been approximately $58.62\\nmillion, or $1.72 per share of common stock. This represents an immediate increase in the net tangible book value of $0.62 per\\nshare to our existing stockholders and an immediate and substantial dilution in net tangible book value of $7.43 per share to new\\ninvestors. The following table illustrates this hypothetical per share dilution:\\n\\nAssumed public offering price per share\\n$9.15\\n\\nNet tangible book value per share as of September 30, 2020\\n$1.10\\n\\n\\nIncrease in net tangible book value per share attributable to this offering\\n0.62\\n\\n\\nAs adjusted net tangible book value per share as of September 30, 2020, after giving effect to this offering\\n1.72\\n\\nDilution per share to new investors purchasing shares in this offering\\n$7.43\\nThe table above assumes\\nfor illustrative purposes that an aggregate of 2,732,240 shares of our common stock are sold at a price of $9.15 per share, the\\nlast reported sale price of our common stock on the NYSE American on November 25, 2020, for aggregate gross proceeds of $25 million.\\nThe shares sold in this offering, if any, will be sold from time to time at various prices. An increase of $0.62 per share in the\\nprice at which the shares are sold from the assumed offering price of $9.15 per share shown in the table above, assuming all of\\nour common stock in the aggregate amount of $25 million is sold at that price, would increase our adjusted net tangible book value\\nper share after the offering to $1.73 per share and would increase the dilution in net tangible book value per share to new investors\\nin this offering to $8.04 per share, after deducting commissions and estimated aggregate offering expenses payable by us. A decrease\\nof $0.62 per share in the price at which the shares are sold from the assumed offering price of $9.15 per share shown in the table\\nabove, assuming all of our common stock in the aggregate amount of $25 million is sold at that price, would decrease our adjusted\\nnet tangible book value per share after the offering to $1.71 per share and would decrease the dilution in net tangible book value\\nper share to new investors in this offering to $6.82 per share, after deducting commissions and estimated aggregate offering expenses\\npayable by us. This information is supplied for illustrative purposes only.To the extent that\\nany outstanding options or warrants are exercised, new options are issued under our 2019 Stock Incentive Plan or we otherwise issue\\nadditional shares of common stock in the future, there will be further dilution to new investors.The above discussion\\nand table are based on 31,348,171 shares of our common stock outstanding as of September 30, 2020 and excludes the following securities\\noutstanding on September 30, 2020:\\n●options to purchase an aggregate of 1,086,984 shares of our common stock issued to our officers,\\ndirectors, employees and non-employee consultants under our 2019 Stock Incentive Plan, with a weighted average exercise price of\\n$5.11 per share;\\n●options to purchase an aggregate of 1,325,369 shares of our common stock issued to our officers,\\ndirectors, employees and non-employee consultants under our 2013 Stock Incentive Plan, with a weighted average exercise price of\\n$8.99 per share;\\n●options to purchase an aggregate of 15,334 shares of our common stock issued to our officers, directors,\\nemployees and non-employee consultants under our 2006 Stock Plan, with a weighted average exercise price of $6.18 per share;\\n\\n●52,000 shares of Series C-3 Preferred Stock, which are convertible into 104,000 shares of common\\nstock;\\n●89,623 shares of Series E Preferred Stock, which are convertible into 391,953 shares of common\\nstock;\\n\\n●\\n100,000 shares of Series G Preferred Stock, which are convertible into 5,560,137 shares of common stock; \\n\\n\\n●\\n45,326 shares of our common stock issuable in connection with our Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors, pursuant to which our non-employee directors may defer all of their cash director fees and restricted stock units; and\\n\\n\\n●\\nwarrants to purchase an aggregate of 183,148 shares of common stock with a weighted average exercise price of $4.96 per share.\\nPLAN\\nOF DISTRIBUTIONWe have entered into\\nan Amended and Restated At Market Issuance Sales Agreement referred to as the sales agreement, with B.

This summary is not complete and does not contain all of the information that\\nyou should consider before deciding whether to invest in our securities. For a more complete understanding of our company and\\nthe securities offered hereby, we encourage you to read and consider carefully the more detailed information in this prospectus,\\nincluding the information incorporated by reference into this prospectus, and the information referred to under the heading “Risk\\nFactors” in this prospectus beginning on page 9, and in the documents incorporated by reference into this prospectus.OUR\\nCOMPANYOverviewWe\\nare a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing therapeutic products for the prevention and treatment\\nof infectious and inflammatory diseases.In late 2013, we met with the FDA to\\ndetermine the regulatory pathway for U.S. marketing approval of Defencath and began discussions on the clinical development program.\\nIn January 2015, the FDA granted Fast Track designation to Defencath, which is a program designed to facilitate development of\\ndrugs that are intended to treat serious and life-threatening conditions and to address an unmet medical need. Fast Track designation\\nprovides eligibility to request Priority Review of the marketing application.Also, in January 2015, the FDA designated\\nDefencath as a Qualified Infectious Disease Product, or QIDP, which provides for an extension of five years of marketing exclusivity\\nto be added to any exclusivity for which the application qualifies upon approval. For example, an additional five years of marketing\\nexclusivity will be added to the five years granted to a New Chemical Entity, or NCE, upon approval of the New Drug Application,\\nor NDA. QIDP designation also confers eligibility for Priority Review of the NDA.We\\nlaunched the Phase 3 Prospective, Multicenter, Double-blind, Randomized, Active Control Study to Demonstrate Safety  Effectiveness\\nof Defencath/Neutrolin in Preventing Catheter related Bloodstream Infection in Subjects on Hemodialysis for End Stage Renal Disease\\n(LOCK-IT-100) in patients with hemodialysis catheters in the U.S. in December 2015. The clinical trial was designed to demonstrate\\nthe safety and effectiveness of Defencath compared to the standard of care CLS, Heparin, in preventing CRBSIs. The primary endpoint\\nfor the trial assessed the incidence of CRBSI and time to CRBSI for each study subject. Secondary endpoints were catheter patency,\\nwhich was defined as required use of tissue plasminogen activating factor, or tPA, or removal of catheter due to dysfunction,\\nand removal of catheter for any reason.In\\nJuly 2018, 28 potential cases of CRBSI were identified in LOCK-IT-100 that occurred through early December 2017. As previously\\nagreed with the FDA, an interim efficacy analysis was performed based on the first 28 cases. There was a highly statistically\\nsignificant 72% reduction in CRBSI by Defencath relative to the active control of Heparin (p=0.0034). Because the pre-specified\\nlevel of statistical significance was reached for the primary endpoint and efficacy had been demonstrated with no safety concerns,\\nthe independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) recommended early termination.Following\\ndiscussions with the FDA, we proceeded with an orderly termination of LOCK-IT-100. The study had continued enrolling and treating\\nsubjects until study termination, and the final analysis was based on a total of 795 subjects.We remained blinded until the topline\\nresults of the full data set of LOCK-IT-100 were announced in late January 2019. In a total of 41 cases, there was a 71% reduction\\nin CRBSI by Defencath relative to Heparin, which was highly statistically significant (p=0.0006), with a good safety profile.\\nDuring 2019, we had a series of meetings with the FDA to discuss the analyses of data from LOCK-IT-100, including an end of Phase\\n3 meeting, a pre-NDA meeting and a CMC meeting, in preparation for submission of the NDA.The FDA granted our request for a rolling\\nsubmission and review of the NDA, which is designed to expedite the approval process for products being developed to address an\\nunmet medical need. Although the FDA usually requires two pivotal clinical trials to provide substantial evidence of safety and\\neffectiveness for approval of an NDA, the FDA will in some cases accept one adequate and well-controlled trial, where it is a\\nlarge multicenter trial with a broad range of subjects and study sites that has demonstrated a clinically meaningful and statistically\\nvery persuasive effect on a disease with potentially serious outcome. In March 2020, we began the modular submission process for\\nthe NDA for Defencath for the prevention of CRBSI in hemodialysis patients, and recently announced on July 8, 2020, that submission\\nof all modules for the NDA was completed. In August 2020, the FDA accepted for filing the Defencath NDA and also granted our request\\nfor Priority Review. Priority Review provides for six-month review period instead of the standard ten-month review period, and\\nFebruary 28, 2021 has been set as the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, date for the completion of the review for approval\\nof the NDA.\\xa0The FDA noted that it is planning to hold an advisory committee meeting to discuss the application and that it\\nhad not identified any potential review issues at this time. The meeting of the Antimicrobial Drugs Advisory Committee to discuss\\nthe Defencath NDA has tentatively been scheduled for January 14, 2021. We have not been informed of any delays by the FDA in the\\nreview of the NDA, but the FDA has limited international and domestic travel due to COVID-19, and pre-approval inspections are\\nrequired for manufacturing sites.The FDA also previously agreed that we\\ncould request consideration of Defencath for approval under the Limited Population Pathway for Antibacterial and Antifungal Drugs,\\nor LPAD. LPAD, passed as part of the 21st Century Cures Act, is a new program intended to expedite the development and approval\\nof certain antibacterial and antifungal drugs to treat serious or life-threatening infections in limited populations of patients\\nwith unmet medical needs. Given that the LPAD pathway provides for a streamlined clinical development program for a limited population\\nthat may involve smaller, shorter, or fewer clinical trials, we believe that LPAD will provide additional flexibility for the\\nFDA to approve Defencath to prevent CRBSIs in the limited population of adult patients with end stage renal disease receiving\\nhemodialysis through a CVC.We were granted a deferral by the FDA\\nunder the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA that requires sponsors to conduct pediatric studies for NDAs for a new active\\ningredient, such as taurolidine in Defencath, unless a waiver or deferral is obtained from the FDA. A deferral acknowledges that\\na pediatric assessment is required but permits the applicant to submit the pediatric assessment after the submission of an NDA.\\nWe have made a commitment to conduct the pediatric study after approval of the NDA for use in adult hemodialysis patients. Pediatric\\nstudies for an approved product conducted under PREA may qualify for pediatric exclusivity, which if granted would provide an\\nadditional six months of marketing exclusivity. Defencath would then have the potential to receive a total marketing exclusivity\\nperiod of 10.5 years, including exclusivity pursuant to NCE and QIDP.We anticipate that Medicare reimbursement\\ncould be available for Defencath in hemodialysis and other catheter indications in intensive care, oncology and TPN through relevant\\nhospital inpatient diagnosis-related groups, or DRGs, or outpatient ambulatory payment classifications, or APCs, the EndStage\\nRenal Disease Prospective Payment System, or ESRD PPS, base payment, or under the Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics,\\nand Supplies, or DMEPOS, Fee Schedule, depending on the setting of care. We also plan to seek separate reimbursement as a drug,\\nwhere available under Medicare, through mechanisms such as pass-through status under the Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment\\nSystem, the transitional drug add-on payment adjustment, or TDAPA, under the ESRD PPS, or reimbursement as a drug used with a\\nDMEPOS infusion pump. We have engaged U.S. Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services, or CMS, in preliminary discussions concerning\\nthe reimbursement for Defencath under TDAPA; however, qualifications cannot be determined until after FDA approval and CMS evaluates\\nthe request for coverage in a quarterly review. If approved under TDAPA, reimbursement of Defencath would be calculated based\\non its average selling price.Although\\nwe cannot fully anticipate changes in reimbursement requirements and mechanisms in the coming years, we expect Defencath would\\nbe eligible for and would obtain TDAPA. To be eligible for TDAPA, an innovative new renal drug or biologic must be, among other\\nthings, identified as having an end action effect that treats or manages a condition or conditions associated with ESRD and as\\nnot fitting into an established ESRD PPS functional category. We believe that in addition to the Fast Track and QIDP designations\\ngranted by FDA, Defencath meets the criterion of being a new renal dialysis product used to treat or manage a condition associated\\nwith ESRD, since infections are the second leading cause of death in patients with ESRD and CVCs are a significant risk factor\\nfor infection-associated mortality.International\\nIn the European Union, or EU, Neutrolin\\nis regulated as a Class 3 medical device. In July 2013, we received CE Mark approval for Neutrolin. In December 2013, we started\\ncommercial sales of Neutrolin in Germany for the prevention of CRBSI and maintenance of catheter patency in hemodialysis patients\\nusing a tunneled, cuffed CVC for vascular access. To date, Neutrolin is registered and may be sold in certain European Union and\\nMiddle Eastern countries for such treatment.In September 2014, the TUV-SUD and The Medicines Evaluation\\nBoard of the Netherlands, or MEB, granted a label expansion for Neutrolin, to include use in oncology patients receiving chemotherapy,\\nIV hydration and IV medications via CVC for the EU and in December 2014, we received approval from the Hessian District President\\nin Germany to expand the label for these same expanded indications. The expansion also adds patients receiving medication and IV\\nfluids via CVC in intensive or critical care units (cardiac care unit, surgical care unit, neonatal critical care unit, and urgent\\ncare centers). An indication for use in total parenteral nutrition was also approved.Additional\\nDevelopment Possibilities We\\nintend to pursue additional indications for Defencath use as a CLS in populations with an unmet medical need that also represent\\na significant market opportunity. For example, we intend to pursue marketing authorization in the U.S. for use as a CLS to reduce\\nCRBSIs in oncology and total parenteral nutrition patients using a CVC.In addition to the CLS, we are sponsoring\\na pre-clinical research collaboration for the use of taurolidine as a possible treatment for pediatric tumors. In February 2018,\\nthe FDA granted orphan drug designation to taurolidine for the treatment of neuroblastoma in children. We may seek one or more\\nstrategic partners or other sources of capital to help with the development and commercialization of taurolidine for the treatment\\nof neuroblastoma in children. We are also evaluating opportunities for the possible expansion of taurolidine as a platform compound\\nfor use in certain medical devices. Patent applications have been filed in several indications, including wound closure, surgical\\nmeshes, and wound management. Based on initial feasibility work, we are advancing pre-clinical studies for taurolidine-infused\\nsurgical meshes, suture materials and hydrogels. We will seek to establish development/commercial partnerships as these programs\\nadvance.The FDA regards taurolidine as an NCE\\nand therefore it is currently an unapproved new drug. We might in the future pursue product candidates that would involve devices\\nimpregnated with taurolidine, and we believe that at the current time such products would be combination products subject to device\\npremarket submission requirements, while subject also, under review by FDA, to the standards for drug approvability. Consequently,\\ngiven that there is no appropriate predicate medical device currently marketed in the U.S. on which a 510(k) approval process\\ncould be based and that taurolidine is not yet approved in any application, we anticipate that we would be required to submit\\na premarket approval application, or PMA, for marketing authorization for any medical device indications that we may pursue for\\ndevices containing taurolidine. In the event that an NDA for Defencath is approved by the FDA, the regulatory pathway for these\\nmedical device product candidates may be revisited with the FDA. Although there may be no appropriate predicate, de novo Class\\nII designation can be proposed, based on a risk assessment and a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness.In\\nDecember 2019, the novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, was identified in Wuhan, China. This virus has been declared a pandemic\\nand has spread to multiple global regions. The outbreak and government measures taken in response have also had a significant\\nimpact, both direct and indirect, on businesses and commerce, as worker shortages have occurred; supply chains have been disrupted;\\nfacilities and production have been suspended; and demand for certain goods and services, such as medical services and supplies,\\nhas spiked, while demand for other goods and services, such as travel, has fallen. In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, “shelter\\nin place” orders and other public health guidance measures have been implemented across much of the United States, Europe\\nand Asia, including in the locations of our offices, clinical trial sites, key vendors and partners. Our program timelines may\\nbe negatively affected by COVID-19, which could materially and adversely affect business, financial conditions and results of\\noperations.Corporate\\nHistory and InformationWe were organized as a Delaware corporation on July 28, 2006\\nunder the name “Picton Holding Company, Inc.” and we changed our corporate name to “CorMedix Inc.” on January\\n18, 2007.

Pending the application of the\\nnet proceeds, we intend to invest a portion of the net proceeds generally in short-term, investment grade, interest-bearing securities.PLAN\\nOF DISTRIBUTIONWe\\nmay sell the securities from time to time by a variety of methods, including:\\n\\n●\\non\\nthe NYSE American or any other national securities exchange or U.S. inter-dealer system of a registered national securities association\\non which our common stock or other securities may be listed or quoted at the time of sale; \\n\\n●\\nin\\nprivately negotiated transactions; \\n\\n●\\nin\\nan exchange distribution in accordance with the rules of the applicable exchange; \\n\\n●\\nas\\nsettlement of short sales entered into after the date of the prospectus; \\n\\n●\\nthrough\\n    the writing or settlement of options or other hedging transactions, whether through an options exchange or otherwise; \\n\\n●\\nthrough\\nbroker-dealers, who may act as agents or principals; \\n\\n●\\nthrough\\nsales “at the market” to or through a market-maker; \\n\\n●\\nin\\na block trade, in which a broker-dealer will attempt to sell a block as agent but may position and resell a portion of the block\\nas principal to facilitate the transaction; \\n\\n●\\nthrough\\none or more underwriters on a firm commitment or best-efforts basis; \\n\\n●\\ndirectly\\nto one or more purchasers; \\n\\n●\\nthrough\\nagents; \\n\\n●\\nin\\noptions transactions; \\n\\n●\\nover\\nthe Internet; \\n\\n●\\nany\\nother method permitted pursuant to applicable law; or \\n\\n●\\nin\\nany combination of the above. \\nIn\\neffecting sales, brokers or dealers engaged by us may arrange for other brokers or dealers to participate. Broker-dealer transactions\\nmay include:\\n\\n●\\npurchases of the securities by a broker-dealer as principal and resales of the securities by the broker-dealer for its account pursuant to this prospectus; \\n\\n●\\nordinary brokerage transactions; or \\n\\n●\\ntransactions in which the broker-dealer solicits purchasers. \\nWe\\nmay sell the securities to or through underwriters or dealers, through agents, or directly to one or more purchasers. We may distribute\\nsecurities from time to time in one or more transactions:\\n\\n●\\nat\\n    a fixed price or prices, which may be changed;\\n\\n\\n●\\nat\\n    market prices prevailing at the time of sale;\\n\\n\\n●\\nat\\n    prices related to such prevailing market prices; or\\n\\n\\n●\\nat\\n    negotiated prices.\\nEach\\nprospectus supplement will describe the method of distribution of the securities and any applicable restrictions.A\\nprospectus supplement or supplements (and any related free writing prospectus that we may authorize to be provided to you) will\\ndescribe the terms of the offering of the securities, including, to the extent applicable:\\n\\n●\\nthe\\n    name or names of the underwriters, if any;\\n\\n\\n●\\nthe\\n    purchase price of the securities or other consideration therefor, and the proceeds, if any, we will receive from the sale;\\n\\n\\n●\\nany\\n    over-allotment options under which underwriters may purchase additional securities from us;\\n\\n\\n●\\nany\\n    agency fees or underwriting discounts and other items constituting agents’ or underwriters’ compensation;\\n\\n\\n●\\nany\\n    public offering price;\\n\\n\\n●\\nany\\n    discounts or concessions allowed or reallowed or paid to dealers; and\\n\\n\\n●\\nany\\n    securities exchange or market on which the securities may be listed.\\nOnly\\nunderwriters named in the prospectus supplement will be underwriters of the securities offered by the prospectus supplement.If\\nunderwriters are used in the sale, they will acquire the securities for their own account and may resell the securities from time\\nto time in one or more transactions at a fixed public offering price or at varying prices determined at the time of sale. The\\nobligations of the underwriters to purchase the securities will be subject to the conditions set forth in the applicable underwriting\\nagreement. We may offer the securities to the public through underwriting syndicates represented by managing underwriters or by\\nunderwriters without a syndicate. Subject to certain conditions, the underwriters will be obligated to purchase all of the securities\\noffered by the prospectus supplement, other than securities covered by any over-allotment option. Any public offering price and\\nany discounts or concessions allowed or reallowed or paid to dealers may change from time to time. We may use underwriters with\\nwhom we have a material relationship. We will describe in the prospectus supplement, naming the underwriter, the nature of any\\nsuch relationship.We\\nmay sell securities directly or through agents we designate from time to time. We will name any agent involved in the offering\\nand sale of securities and we will describe any commissions we will pay the agent in the prospectus supplement. Unless the prospectus\\nsupplement states otherwise, our agent will act on a best-efforts basis for the period of its appointment.We\\nmay authorize agents or underwriters to solicit offers by certain types of institutional investors to purchase securities from\\nus at the public offering price set forth in the prospectus supplement pursuant to delayed delivery contracts providing for payment\\nand delivery on a specified date in the future. We will describe the conditions to these contracts and the commissions we must\\npay for solicitation of these contracts in the prospectus supplement.We\\nmay provide agents and underwriters with indemnification against civil liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities\\nAct, or contribution with respect to payments that the agents or underwriters may make with respect to these liabilities. Agents\\nand underwriters may engage in transactions with, or perform services for, us in the ordinary course of business.All\\nsecurities we may offer, other than common stock, will be new issues of securities with no established trading market. Any underwriters\\nmay make a market in these securities, but will not be obligated to do so and may discontinue any market making at any time without\\nnotice. We cannot guarantee the liquidity of the trading markets for any securities.Any\\nunderwriter may engage in over-allotment, stabilizing transactions, short-covering transactions and penalty bids in accordance\\nwith Regulation\\xa0M under the Exchange Act. Over-allotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which create a short\\nposition. Stabilizing transactions permit bids to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed\\na specified maximum price. Syndicate-covering or other short-covering transactions involve purchases of the securities, either\\nthrough exercise of the over-allotment option or in the open market after the distribution is completed, to cover short positions.\\nPenalty bids permit the underwriters to reclaim a selling concession from a dealer when the securities originally sold by the\\ndealer are purchased in a stabilizing or covering transaction to cover short positions. Those activities may cause the price of\\nthe securities to be higher than it would otherwise be. If commenced, the underwriters may discontinue any of the activities at\\nany time.Any\\nunderwriters that are qualified market makers on the NYSE American may engage in passive market making transactions in the common\\nstock on the NYSE American in accordance with Regulation\\xa0M under the Exchange Act, during the business day prior to the pricing\\nof the offering, before the commencement of offers or sales of the common stock. Passive market makers must comply with applicable\\nvolume and price limitations and must be identified as passive market makers. In general, a passive market maker must display\\nits bid at a price not in excess of the highest independent bid for such security; if all independent bids are lowered below the\\npassive market maker’s bid, however, the passive market maker’s bid must then be lowered when certain purchase limits\\nare exceeded. Passive market making may stabilize the market price of the securities at a level above that which might otherwise\\nprevail in the open market and, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time.DESCRIPTION\\nOF OUR CAPITAL STOCKCommon\\nStockThe\\nfollowing is a summary of certain provisions of our capital stock. Such summary does not purport to be complete. You should refer\\nto our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, and our Second Amended and Restated Bylaws and each Certificate\\nof Designation for our Series C-3, E and G preferred stock, in each case, incorporated by reference as an exhibit to our most\\nrecent Form 10-K. The summary below is also qualified by provisions of such documents and applicable law. Pursuant\\nto our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, we are authorized to issue 160,000,000 shares of common\\nstock, $0.001 par value per share. As of November 4, 2020, we had 32,132,492 shares of common stock outstanding.The\\nholders of our common stock are entitled to one vote per share on all matters to be voted on by the stockholders, and there are\\nno cumulative voting rights. Generally, all matters to be voted on by stockholders must be approved by a majority (or, in the\\ncase of election of directors, by a plurality) of the votes entitled to be cast by all shares of common stock present in person\\nor represented by proxy, subject to any voting rights granted to holders of any preferred stock.The\\nholders of common stock are entitled to receive ratable dividends, if any, payable in cash, in stock or otherwise if, as and when\\ndeclared from time to time by our Board of Directors out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends, subject to any\\npreferential rights that may be applicable to any outstanding preferred stock. In the event of a liquidation, dissolution, or\\nwinding up of our Company, after payment in full of all outstanding debts and other liabilities, the holders of common stock are\\nentitled to share ratably in all remaining assets, subject to prior distribution rights of preferred stock, if any, then outstanding.\\nNo shares of common stock have preemptive rights or other subscription rights to purchase additional shares of common stock. There\\nare no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the common stock. All outstanding shares of common stock are fully\\npaid and nonassessable. The rights, preferences and privileges of holders of our common stock will be subject to, and might be\\nadversely affected by, the rights of holders of any preferred stock that we may issue in the future. All shares of common stock\\nthat are acquired by us shall be available for reissuance by us at any time.Issued\\nand Outstanding Preferred StockUnder\\nthe terms of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, our Board of Directors is authorized to issue\\nup to 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series without stockholder approval. Our Board of Directors has the discretion\\nto determine the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions, including voting rights, dividend rights, conversion rights,\\nredemption privileges and liquidation preferences, of each series of preferred stock. As of November\\xa04, 2020, of the 2,000,000\\nshares of preferred stock authorized, our Board of Directors has designated (all with par value of $0.001 per share): 200,000\\nshares as Series C-3 Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock; 89,623 shares as Series E Convertible Preferred Stock and 100,000\\nas Series G Convertible Preferred Stock. At November\\xa04, 2020, we had outstanding: 52,000 shares of Series C-3 Non-Voting Convertible\\nPreferred Stock; 89,623 shares of Series E Convertible Preferred Stock and 100,000 shares of Series G Convertible Preferred Stock.Series\\nC-3 Non-Voting Convertible Preferred StockThe\\nSeries C-3 Preferred Stock has the rights, privileges and terms described below.Rank.\\nThe Series C-3 Preferred Stock will rank:\\n\\n●\\nsenior\\n    to our common stock; \\n\\n\\n●\\nsenior\\n    to any class or series of capital stock created after the issuance of the Series C-3 Preferred Stock; and \\n\\n\\n●\\njunior\\n    to the Series E Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock, in\\neach case, as to dividends or distributions of assets upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up whether voluntarily or involuntarily.\\nConversion.\\nEach share of Series C-3 Preferred Stock is convertible into 10 shares of our common stock (subject to adjustment in the event\\nof stock dividends and distributions, stock splits, stock combinations, or reclassifications affecting our common stock) at a\\nper share price of $1.00 at any time at the option of the holder, except that a holder will be prohibited from converting shares\\nof Series C-3 Preferred Stock into shares of common stock if, as a result of such conversion, such holder, together with its affiliates,\\nwould beneficially own more than 9.99% of the total number of shares of our common stock then issued and outstanding.Liquidation\\nPreference. In the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, holders of Series C-3 Preferred Stock will receive\\na payment equal to $10.00 per share of Series C-3 Preferred Stock before any proceeds are distributed to the holders of our common\\nstock.

The shares of preferred\\nstock outstanding are described above. The issuance of new or additional preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power\\nof holders of common stock and the likelihood that such holders will receive dividend payments and payments upon liquidation and\\ncould have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our company.We\\nwill fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of any new series of preferred stock in the certificate of designation\\nrelating to that series. We will file as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part, or will\\nincorporate by reference from reports that we file with the SEC, the form of any certificate of designation that describes the\\nterms of the series of preferred stock we are offering before the issuance of the related series of preferred stock. This description\\nwill include any or all of the following, as required:\\n\\n●\\nthe\\n    title and stated value;\\n\\n\\n●\\nthe\\n    number of shares we are offering;\\n\\n\\n●\\nthe\\n    liquidation preference per share;\\n\\n\\n●\\nthe\\n    purchase price;\\n\\n\\n●\\nthe\\n    dividend rate, period and payment date and method of calculation for dividends;\\n\\n\\n●\\nwhether\\n    dividends will be cumulative or non-cumulative and, if cumulative, the date from which dividends will accumulate;\\n\\n\\n●\\nthe\\n    procedures for any auction and remarketing, if any;\\n\\n\\n●\\nthe\\n    provisions for a sinking fund, if any;\\n\\n\\n●\\nthe\\n    provisions for redemption or repurchase, if applicable, and any restrictions on our ability to exercise those redemption and\\n    repurchase rights;\\n\\n\\n●\\nany\\n    listing of the preferred stock on any securities exchange or market;\\n\\n\\n●\\nwhether\\n    the preferred stock will be convertible into our common stock, and, if applicable, the conversion price, or how it will be\\n    calculated, and the conversion period;\\n\\n\\n●\\nwhether\\n    the preferred stock will be exchangeable into debt securities, and, if applicable, the exchange price, or how it will be calculated,\\n    and the exchange period;\\n\\n\\n●\\nvoting\\n    rights, if any, of the preferred stock;\\n\\n\\n●\\npreemptive\\n    rights, if any;\\n\\n\\n●\\nrestrictions\\n    on transfer, sale or other assignment, if any;\\n\\n\\n●\\nwhether\\n    interests in the preferred stock will be represented by depositary shares;\\n\\n\\n●\\na\\n    discussion of any material or special United States federal income tax considerations applicable to the preferred stock;\\n\\n\\n●\\nthe\\n    relative ranking and preferences of the preferred stock as to dividend rights and rights if we liquidate, dissolve or wind\\n    up our affairs;\\n\\n\\n●\\nany\\n    limitations on issuance of any class or series of preferred stock ranking senior to or on a parity with the series of preferred\\n    stock as to dividend rights and rights if we liquidate, dissolve or wind up our affairs; and\\n\\n\\n●\\nany\\n    other specific terms, preferences, rights or limitations of, or restrictions on, the preferred stock.\\nIf\\nwe issue shares of preferred stock under this prospectus, the shares will be fully paid and non-assessable.The\\nGeneral Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, the state of our incorporation, provides that the holders of preferred stock\\nwill have the right to vote separately as a class on any proposal involving fundamental changes in the rights of holders of that\\npreferred stock. This right is in addition to any voting rights that may be provided for in the applicable certificate of designation.Our\\nboard of directors may authorize the issuance of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect\\nthe voting power or other rights of the holders of our common stock. Preferred stock could be issued quickly with terms designed\\nto delay or prevent a change in control of our company or make removal of management more difficult. Additionally, the issuance\\nof preferred stock may have the effect of decreasing the market price of our common stock.Certain\\nAnti-Takeover Provisions of Delaware Law and of Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Second Amended and Restated\\nBylawsCertain\\nprovisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”) and our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation,\\nas amended, and our Second Amended and Restated Bylaws discussed below may have the effect of making more difficult or discouraging\\na tender offer, proxy contest or other takeover attempt. These provisions are expected to encourage persons seeking to acquire\\ncontrol of our Company to first negotiate with our Board of Directors. We believe that the benefits of increasing our ability\\nto negotiate with the proponent of an unfriendly or unsolicited proposal to acquire or restructure our Company outweigh the disadvantages\\nof discouraging these proposals because negotiation of these proposals could result in an improvement of their terms.Delaware\\nAnti-takeover LawWe\\nare subject to Section 203 of the DGCL, an anti-takeover law. In general, Section 203 prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation\\nfrom engaging in a “business combination” with an “interested stockholder” for a period of three years\\nfollowing the date the person became an interested stockholder, unless:\\n\\n●\\nthe\\n    Board of Directors approves the transaction in which the stockholder became an interested stockholder prior to the date the\\n    interested stockholder attained that status;\\n\\n\\n●\\nwhen\\n    the stockholder became an interested stockholder, he or she owned at least 85% of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding\\n    at the time the transaction commenced, excluding shares owned by persons who are directors and also officers and certain shares\\n    owned by employee benefits plans; or\\n\\n\\n●\\non\\n    or subsequent to the date the business combination is approved by the Board of Directors, the business combination is authorized\\n    by the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3% of the voting stock of the corporation at an annual or special meeting of stockholders.\\nGenerally,\\na “business combination” includes a merger, asset or stock sale, or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit\\nto the interested stockholder. Generally, an “interested stockholder” is a person who, together with affiliates and\\nassociates, owns, or is an affiliate or associate of the corporation and within three years prior to the determination of interested\\nstockholder status did own, 15% or more of a corporation’s voting stock.The\\nexistence of Section 203 of the DGCL would be expected to have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved\\nin advance by our Board of Directors, including discouraging attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for\\nthe shares of our common stock.Charter\\nDocumentsOur\\nAmended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, and Second Amended and Restated Bylaws include a number of provisions\\nthat may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or delaying or preventing changes in control or management of our Company.\\nFirst, our Second Amended and Restated Bylaws limit who may call special meetings of the stockholders, such meetings may only\\nbe called by the chairman of the Board of Directors, the chief executive officer, the Board of Directors or holders of an aggregate\\nof at least 15% of our outstanding entitled to vote. Second, our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation does not include\\na provision for cumulative voting for directors. Under cumulative voting, a minority stockholder holding a sufficient percentage\\nof a class of shares may be able to ensure the election of one or more directors. Third, our Second Amended and Restated Bylaws\\nprovide that the number of directors on our Board of Directors, which may range from five to nine directors, shall be exclusively\\nfixed by our Board of Directors, which has set the number of directors at seven. Fourth, newly created directorships resulting\\nfrom any increase in our authorized number of directors and any vacancies in our Board of Directors resulting from death, resignation,\\nretirement, disqualification or other cause (including removal from office by a vote of the shareholders) will be filled by a\\nmajority of our Board of Directors then in office. Finally, our Second Amended and Restated Bylaws establish procedures, including\\n90-day advance notice requirement, with regard to the nomination of candidates for election as directors and stockholder proposals.\\nThese and other provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Second Amended and Restated Bylaws and\\nDelaware law could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control or management of\\nour Company.DESCRIPTION\\nOF DEBT SECURITIESThe\\nfollowing description, together with the additional information we include in any applicable prospectus supplement, summarizes\\nthe material terms and provisions of any debt securities that we may offer under this prospectus.

These risks and uncertainties are not the only ones facing us. There may be other risks that a prospective investor should consider\\nthat are relevant to that investor’s own particular circumstances or generally. Risks Related to the Notes The notes will be effectively subordinated to our existing and future secured debt and the existing and future liabilities of our subsidiaries. The notes are our senior obligations and will rank equally\\nin right of payment with our other existing and future senior unsecured obligations. The notes will not be secured by any of our assets. Any future claims of our secured lenders with respect to assets securing their loans will be prior to any claim\\nof the holders of the notes with respect to those assets. Holders of secured debt that we have now or may issue in the future may foreclose on the assets securing such debt, reducing the cash flow from the foreclosed property available for payment\\nof unsecured debt, including the notes. Holders of our secured debt also would have priority over unsecured creditors in the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation or similar proceeding to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such debt.\\nAs a result, the notes will be effectively subordinated to any secured debt that we may issue in the future to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such debt. Our operations are partially conducted through our\\nsubsidiaries that are separate and distinct legal entities from us. Our subsidiaries have no obligation to pay any amounts due on the notes or to provide us with funds to meet our payment obligations on the notes, whether in the form of dividends,\\ndistributions, loans or other payments. In addition, any payment of dividends, loans or advances by our subsidiaries could be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions. Payments to us by our subsidiaries are contingent upon the\\nsubsidiaries’ earnings, cash flow and other business considerations. Our right to receive any assets of any of our subsidiaries upon their bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization and, therefore, the right of the holders of the notes to\\nparticipate in those assets will be effectively subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary’s creditors, including trade creditors. In addition, even if we are a creditor of any of our subsidiaries, our right as a creditor would be\\nsubordinated to any security interest in such assets of our subsidiaries and any indebtedness of our subsidiaries senior in right of payment to that held by us. At September\\xa030, 2020, we had approximately $19\\xa0million of indebtedness\\noutstanding on a consolidated basis that would rank structurally senior to the notes and approximately $13,108\\xa0million of indebtedness outstanding on a consolidated basis that would rank equally with the notes. At September\\xa030, 2020, on a\\npro forma basis after giving effect to our entry into, and borrowing in full under, a $400\\xa0million term loan agreement on November\\xa010, 2020, we had total debt of $13,527\\xa0million. We may issue additional notes. Under the terms of the Indenture that governs the notes, we\\nmay from time to time without notice to, or the consent of, the holders of the notes, create and issue additional notes of a new or existing series, which notes, if of an existing series, will be equal in rank to the outstanding notes of that series\\nin all material respects so that the new notes may be consolidated and form a single series with such notes and have the same terms and conditions as to status, redemption or otherwise (except for the issue date, the public offering price and, in\\nsome cases, the first interest payment date as described under “Description of the Notes—General”) as such notes. If the additional notes, if any, are not fungible with the notes offered hereby for U.S. federal income tax purposes,\\nthe additional notes will have a separate CUSIP number. Redemption may adversely affect your return on the notes. The notes are redeemable at our option and, therefore, we\\nmay choose to redeem the notes at times when prevailing interest rates are relatively low. As a result, you may not obtain your expected return on the notes and may not be able to reinvest the proceeds received from a redemption of the notes in an\\ninvestment that yields a comparable return. If active trading markets do not develop for the notes, you may be unable to sell your notes or to sell your notes at prices that\\nyou deem sufficient. The notes will be a\\nnew issue of securities for which there currently is no established trading market. We do not intend to list the notes on any national securities exchange. While the underwriters of the notes have advised us that they intend to make a market in the\\nnotes, the underwriters will not be obligated to do so and may stop their market making at any time. No assurance can be given: \\n\\n•\\n that a market for the notes will develop or continue; \\n\\n•\\n as to the liquidity of any market that does develop; and \\n\\n•\\n as to your ability to sell your notes or the prices at which you may be able to sell your notes. We may not be able to repurchase the notes upon a\\nchange of control. Upon the occurrence\\nof a Change of Control Repurchase Event, each holder of notes will have the right to require us to offer to repurchase all or any part of such holder’s notes for cash at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid\\ninterest, if any, to the date of such repurchase. If a Change of Control Repurchase Event occurs, there can be no assurance that we would have sufficient financial resources available to satisfy our obligations to repurchase the notes or that the\\nterms of other indebtedness will not preclude us from doing so. Our failure to repurchase the notes as required under the Indenture governing the notes would result in a default under the Indenture, which could result in other defaults under our and\\nour subsidiaries’ various debt agreements and other arrangements and have material adverse consequences for us and the holders of the notes. See “Description of the Notes—Repurchase at the Option of Holders Upon Change of Control\\nRepurchase Event.” An investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Before deciding whether to invest in our common stock, you should\\ncarefully consider the risks described below and those discussed under the section titled “Risk Factors” contained in our Annual Report on Form\\xa010-K\\xa0for the year ended December\\xa031,\\n2019 as updated by our annual, quarterly and other reports and documents that are incorporated by reference into this prospectus, before deciding whether to purchase any of the securities being registered pursuant to the registration statement of\\nwhich this prospectus is a part. Each of the risk factors could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our securities, and the occurrence of\\nany of these risks might cause you to lose all or part of your investment. Such risks may be amplified by the\\xa0COVID-19\\xa0pandemic and its potential impact on our business and the global economy.\\nAdditional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also significantly impair our business operations. Please also read carefully the section below titled “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking\\nStatements.” Risks Related to this Offering Our management might apply the net proceeds from this offering in ways with which you do not agree and in ways that may impair the value\\nof your investment. We currently intend to use the net proceeds from this offering primarily to fund the development of our drug\\ncandidates and for working capital and general corporate purposes. We may also use the net proceeds from this offering for certain\\xa0pre-commercialization\\xa0activities and to acquire or invest in\\nbusinesses, products or technologies that are complementary to our own, although we have no current plans, commitments or agreements with respect to any acquisitions as of the date of this prospectus. Pending the use of net proceeds from this\\noffering as further described in the section titled “Use of Proceeds,” we intend to invest the net proceeds in short-term, investment-grade, interest bearing obligations, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the\\nUnited States. Our management has broad discretion as to the use of these proceeds and you will be relying on the judgment of our management regarding the application of these proceeds. We might apply these proceeds in ways with which you do not\\nagree, or in ways that do not yield a favorable return. If our management applies these proceeds in a manner that does not yield a significant return, if any, on our investment of these net proceeds, it could compromise our ability to pursue our\\ngrowth strategy and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. You may experience future dilution as a result of future\\nequity offerings. We will require more capital to pursue our preclinical and clinical activities, regulatory approval and the\\ncommercialization of our current or future drug candidates. In addition, we may also choose to raise additional capital due to market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future\\noperating plans. To raise additional capital, we may in the future offer additional shares of our common stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock at prices that may not be the same as the price per share in\\nthis offering. We may sell shares or other securities in any other offering at a price per share that is less than the price per share paid by investors in this offering, and investors purchasing shares or other securities in the future could have\\nrights superior to existing stockholders. The price per share at which we sell additional shares of our common stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into common stock, in future transactions may be higher or lower than the price per share\\npaid by investors in this offering. It is not possible to predict the actual number of shares we will sell under the sales\\nagreement, or the gross proceeds resulting from those sales. Subject to certain limitations in the sales agreement and compliance\\nwith applicable law, we have the discretion to deliver instruction to Cowen to sell shares of our common stock at any time throughout the term of \\nthe sales agreement. The number of shares that are sold through Cowen after our instruction will fluctuate based on a number of factors, including the market price of our common stock during the\\nsales period, the limits we set with Cowen in any instruction to sell shares, and the demand for our common stock during the sales period. Because the price per share of each share sold will fluctuate during this offering, it is not currently\\npossible to predict the number of shares that will be sold or the gross proceeds to be raised in connection with those sales. The\\ncommon stock offered hereby will be sold in “at the market offerings,” and investors who buy shares at different times will likely pay different prices. Investors who purchase shares in this offering at different times will likely pay different prices, and so may experience different levels of\\ndilution and different outcomes in their investment results. We will have discretion, subject to market demand, to vary the timing, prices, and numbers of shares sold in this offering. In addition, subject to the final determination by our board of\\ndirectors, there is no minimum or maximum sales price for shares to be sold in this offering. Investors may experience a decline in the value of the shares they purchase in this offering as a result of sales made at prices lower than the prices they\\npaid. An investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. The prospectus supplement applicable to each offering of securities will\\ncontain a discussion of the risks applicable to an investment in our securities. Prior to making a decision about investing in our securities, you should carefully consider the specific factors discussed under the heading “Risk Factors” in\\nthe applicable prospectus supplement, together with all of the other information contained or incorporated by reference in the prospectus supplement or appearing or incorporated by reference in this prospectus. You should also consider the risks,\\nuncertainties and assumptions discussed under Part II, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March\\xa031, 2020, which is incorporated herein by\\nreference, and may be amended, supplemented or superseded from time to time by other reports we file with the SEC in the future. The risks and uncertainties we have described are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not\\npresently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our operations. Investing in our ADSs involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risks and the risks described in our Annual Report on\\nForm 20-F for the fiscal year ended December\\xa031, 2019, together with all of the other information contained in this prospectus supplement, the accompanying prospectus and in our filings with the\\nSecurities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, that we have incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, prospects, operating results and\\nfinancial condition could suffer materially. In such event, the trading price of our ADSs could decline and you might lose all or part of your investment. Risks Related to this Offering and Ownership of ADSs The price of the ADSs has been, and is likely to continue to be, highly volatile, which could result in substantial losses for purchases of ADSs in this\\noffering. The price of the ADSs has been, and is likely to continue to be, highly volatile. The stock market in general and the market for smaller\\npharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. As a result of this volatility, you may not be able to sell your ADSs at\\nor above the public offering price and you may lose some or all of your investment. The market price for the ADSs may be influenced by many factors, including: \\n\\n•\\n our ability to commercialize or obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, or delays in\\ncommercializing or obtaining regulatory approval; \\n\\n•\\n announcements relating to our clinical trials, including any periodic updates relating to enrollment of trial\\nsubjects, adverse events, site initiation and timing of release of interim analyses and final trial results; \\n\\n•\\n commencement or termination of collaborations for our development programs; \\n\\n•\\n failure or discontinuation of any of our development programs; \\n\\n•\\n results from, or any delays in, clinical trials relating to our product candidates, including our clinical trials\\nfor elamipretide; \\n\\n•\\n any need to suspend or discontinue clinical trials due to side effects or other safety risks, or any need to\\nconduct studies on the long-term effects associated with the use of our product candidates; \\n\\n•\\n manufacturing issues related to our product candidates for clinical trials or future products for\\ncommercialization; \\n\\n•\\n commercial success and market acceptance of our product candidates following regulatory approval;\\n\\n\\n•\\n undesirable side effects caused by product candidates after they have entered the market; \\n\\n•\\n ability to discover, develop and commercialize additional product candidates; \\n\\n•\\n announcements relating to collaborations that we may enter into with respect to the development or\\ncommercialization of our product candidates; \\n\\n•\\n success of our competitors in discovering, developing or commercializing products; \\n\\n•\\n strategic transactions undertaken by us; \\n\\n•\\n additions or departures of key personnel; \\n\\n•\\n product liability claims related to our clinical trials or product candidates; \\n\\n•\\n business disruptions caused by earthquakes or other natural disasters or a public health crisis (for example, an\\noutbreak of a contagious disease such as COVID-19); \\n\\n•\\n disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights; \\n\\n•\\n U.S. Food and Drug Administration, European Medicines Agency, China’s National Medical Products\\nAdministration or other regulatory actions affecting us or our industry; \\n\\n•\\n healthcare reform measures in the United States; \\n\\n•\\n future sales or issuances of equity or debt securities by us; \\n\\n•\\n fluctuations in our semi-annual operating results; \\n\\n•\\n announcement or expectation of additional financing efforts; \\n\\n•\\n sales of our Ordinary Shares by us, our insiders or other shareholders; \\n\\n•\\n actual and anticipated variations in our results of operations; \\n\\n•\\n changes in securities analysts’ estimates or market perception of our financial performance;\\n\\n\\n•\\n announcements by us of significant acquisitions, disposals, strategic alliances or joint ventures;\\n\\n\\n•\\n market developments affecting us or the markets in which we operate; \\n\\n•\\n regulatory or legal developments, including litigation; \\n\\n•\\n the operating and share price performance of companies that investors consider to be comparable to us;\\n\\n\\n•\\n the depth and liquidity of the market for the ADSs; \\n\\n•\\n the release or expiry of lock-up or other transfer restrictions on our\\nOrdinary Shares and ADSs; \\n\\n•\\n general economic, political and stock market conditions in the United States and the countries in which we\\noperate and elsewhere in the world; and \\n\\n•\\n the other factors described in this “Risk Factors” section and the “Risk Factors” sections of\\nour Annual Report on\\xa0Form 20-F\\xa0for the fiscal year ended December\\xa031, 2019, which are\\nincorporated by reference herein. Additionally, in the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a\\ncompany following a decline in the market price of its securities. This risk is especially relevant for us in light of the significant stock price volatility we and other pharmaceutical companies have experienced in recent years. If we face such\\nlitigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources, which could harm our business. A\\nsignificant portion of our total outstanding shares may be sold into the market, which could cause the market price of the ADSs to decline significantly, even if our business is doing well. Sales of a substantial number of ADSs in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in the market that holders of ADSs intend to\\nsell a significant amount of ADSs, could reduce the market price of the ADSs. After this offering, we will have\\xa014,567,379 ADSs outstanding, based on the 140,675,196 Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs outstanding as of October\\xa031, 2020.\\nAll ADSs we are selling in this offering may be resold in the public market immediately, unless purchased by our affiliates. On June\\xa02, 2020, we entered into the Purchase Agreement with Lincoln Park pursuant to which Lincoln Park has committed to purchase up to\\n$20.0\\xa0million of our ordinary shares. We generally have the right to control the timing and amount of any future sales of ordinary shares to Lincoln Park. Sales of ordinary shares, if any, to Lincoln Park will depend upon market conditions and\\nother factors to be determined by us. We may ultimately decide to sell to Lincoln Park all, some or none of the additional ordinary shares that may be available for us to sell pursuant to the Purchase Agreement. Therefore, sales to Lincoln Park\\ncould result in substantial dilution to \\nthe interests of other holders of our ordinary shares. Additionally, the sale of a substantial number of ordinary shares to Lincoln Park, or the anticipation of such sales, could make it more\\ndifficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and at a price that we might otherwise wish to effect sales. If and when we do sell ordinary shares to Lincoln Park, after Lincoln Park has acquired the ordinary\\nshares, Lincoln Park may resell all, some or none of those ordinary shares at any time or from time to time in its discretion. We have also registered\\n88.5\\xa0million Ordinary Shares that we may issue under our equity compensation plans. These shares can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance and once vested, subject to volume limitations applicable to affiliates. We have broad discretion in the use of the net proceeds from this offering and may not use them effectively. Our management will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds from this offering and could spend the proceeds in ways that do not improve\\nour results of operations or enhance the value of our ADSs. The failure by our management to apply these funds effectively could result in financial losses that could cause the price of our ADSs to decline and delay the development of our product\\ncandidates. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on the ADSs in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, holders of ADSs must rely on capital\\nappreciation, if any, for any return on their investment. We have never declared nor paid cash dividends on our share capital. We currently plan\\nto retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the operation, development and growth of our business. In addition, the terms of our existing loan and security agreement preclude us from paying cash dividends without the consent of our\\nlender. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of the ADSs will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future. However, if we do pay a cash dividend on our Ordinary Shares in the future, we may only pay such dividend out of our profits\\nor share premium (subject to applicable solvency requirements) under Cayman Islands law. If you purchase ADSs in this offering, you will suffer\\nimmediate dilution in the net tangible book value of your investment. The public offering price of the ADSs will be substantially higher than the\\nnet tangible book value per ADS. Therefore, if you purchase ADSs in this offering, you will pay a price per ADS that substantially exceeds our net tangible book value per ADS after this offering. Based on the public offering price of $1.125 per ADS,\\nyou will experience immediate dilution of $1.031 per ADS, representing the difference between our as adjusted net tangible book value per ADS after giving effect to this offering and the public offering price. For a further description of the\\ndilution that you will experience immediately after this offering, see “Dilution.” You may experience future dilution in your ownership\\ninterest as a result of future equity offerings. In order to raise additional capital, we may in the future offer additional ADSs or Ordinary\\nShares or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for ADSs or Ordinary Shares. We may sell securities in any other offering at effective prices that are less than the price paid by investors in this offering, and investors purchasing\\nsecurities in the future could have rights superior to existing holders of ADSs. Morningside Venture (I)\\xa0Investments Limited has a controlling\\nownership interest in our Ordinary Shares and the ability to substantially control all matters submitted to shareholders for approval. As of\\nOctober\\xa031, 2020, Morningside Venture (I)\\xa0Investments Limited, or MVIL, beneficially owned\\xa072.1% of our Ordinary Shares. In addition, certain entities associated within MVIL beneficially owned an additional 9.8% of our Ordinary Shares\\nas of October\\xa031, 2020. As a result, MVIL and such entities are able to control all matters submitted to our shareholders for approval that require an ordinary resolution or special resolution, as well as our\\n\\nmanagement and affairs. For example, MVIL would control the election of directors and approval of any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. This concentration\\nof ownership control may: \\n\\n•\\n delay, defer or prevent a change in control; \\n\\n•\\n entrench our management or the board of directors; or \\n\\n•\\n impede a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us that other shareholders may\\ndesire. MVIL owns a controlling portion of our Ordinary Shares and may have conflicts of interest with us and other shareholders\\nin the future. The interests of MVIL may not always be consistent with the interests of our company or of our other shareholders. Accordingly,\\nMVIL could cause us to enter into transactions or agreements of which other holders of our Ordinary Shares would not approve or make decisions with which such holders would disagree. Gerald L. Chan, one of our directors, is a co-founder of the Morningside group, a private investment group with venture, private equity and property investments. In addition, Reenie McCarthy, our Chief Executive Officer and a director, served as a member of\\nthe investment team at Morningside Technology Advisory, LLC (and affiliates) from 1993 through 2016, and remains a director of Morningside Technology Advisory, LLC, which provides advisory services to entities associated with the Morningside group.\\nAlthough Dr.\\xa0Chan is not an officer, director or employee of MVIL and has neither voting nor dispositive control over the Ordinary Shares held by\\nMVIL and does not otherwise beneficially own such shares, as a result of his ongoing relationship with the Morningside group, transactions between us and MVIL may present an actual or perceived conflict of interest. Although Ms.\\xa0McCarthy is not\\nan officer, director or employee of MVIL, and has neither voting nor dispositive control over our Ordinary Shares held by MVIL and does not otherwise beneficially own such shares, as a result of her historic relationship with the Morningside group\\nand her ongoing relationship with Morningside Technology Advisory, LLC, transactions between us and MVIL may present an actual or perceived conflict of interest. Any actual or perceived conflicts of interest may lead Dr.\\xa0Chan and\\nMs.\\xa0McCarthy to recuse themselves from actions of our board of directors with respect to transactions involving MVIL and its affiliates. For example, in a situation in which MVIL is adverse to us, such as if it breaches an agreement with us, a\\nconflict could arise. We may not be able to resolve any potential conflicts, and even if we do, the resolution may be less favorable than if we were dealing with an unaffiliated party. MVIL is in the business of making investments in companies and could from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete with us. MVIL may\\nalso pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and as a result, desirable acquisitions may not be available to us. So long as MVIL continues to own a significant amount of our equity, it will continue to be able to\\nstrongly influence or effectively control our decisions. Before\\npurchasing our common stock you should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below and under the heading “Risk Factors”\\nincluded in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, as updated by our recent Form 8-K Report filed with the Securities and\\nExchange Commission on May 8, 2020, as revised or supplemented by our subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, each of which\\nare on file with the SEC and are incorporated herein by reference, as well as all other information contained in this prospectus\\nsupplement and the accompanying prospectus and incorporated by reference and any free writing prospectus that we have authorized\\nfor use in connection with this offering. The risks and uncertainties described below and in our most recent Annual Report on\\nForm 10-K, as revised or supplemented by our subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, are not the only risks and uncertainties\\nwe face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our\\nbusiness operations. If any of the risks described below or in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, as revised or supplemented\\nby our subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations\\ncould suffer. As a result, the trading price of our stock could decline, perhaps significantly, and you could lose all or part\\nof your investment. The risks discussed below and in most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, as revised or supplemented by our\\nsubsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, also include forward-looking statements and our actual results may differ substantially\\nfrom those discussed in these forward-looking statements. See the section entitled “Forward-Looking Information.”Risks\\nRelated To Our Financial Condition and Need For Additional CapitalWe\\nhave incurred significant losses since our inception and expect to continue to experience losses for the foreseeable future.We\\nhave incurred significant net losses and negative cash flow in each year since our inception, including net losses of approximately\\n $22.0 million and $12.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019, respectively, and approximately\\n$15.6 million and $11.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, and 2018, respectively. As of September 30, 2020, our accumulated\\ndeficit was approximately $150.0 million. We have devoted a significant amount of our financial resources to research and development,\\nincluding our nonclinical development activities and clinical trials. We expect that the costs associated with our plans to begin\\npreclinical research, contract manufacturing and file an IND for our TerraCoV2 vaccine product candidate and the research and\\ndevelopment of our product candidates pursuant to our exclusive channel partnerships with Eleszto Genetika, Inc. (an assignee\\nof Precigen) in the area of lantibiotics (“Lantibiotics Program”) will continue to increase the level of our overall\\nexpenses significantly going forward. Additionally, our NIAID license also requires the payment of certain recurring and performance-based\\nroyalties that may negatively impact our financial capabilities. As a result, we expect to continue to incur substantial net losses\\nand negative cash flow for the foreseeable future. These losses and negative cash flows have had, and will continue to have, an\\nadverse effect on our shareholders’ equity and working capital. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated\\nwith product development and commercialization, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of substantial expenses\\nor when, or if, we will be able to generate the revenue necessary to achieve or maintain profitability.S-9We\\nwill need to raise additional capital in the future to complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates\\nand operate our business.Developing\\nand commercializing biopharmaceutical products, including conducting nonclinical studies and clinical trials and establishing\\nmanufacturing capabilities, and the progress of our efforts to develop and commercialize our product candidates, including our\\nacquisition of a vaccine product candidate is expensive, and can cause us to use our limited, available capital resources faster\\nthan we currently anticipate. We anticipate that our cash resources as of September 30, 2020, together with the proceeds from\\nrecent warrant exercises, will be sufficient to fund our operations as presently structured into the first quarter of 2021. Our\\nactual costs may ultimately vary from our current expectations, which could materially impact our use of capital and our forecast\\nof the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations. Our current cash, cash\\nequivalents and short-term investments are not sufficient to fully implement our business strategy and sustain our operations.\\nAccordingly, we will need to seek additional sources of financing and such additional financing may not be available on favorable\\nterms, if at all. Until we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenue, if ever, we expect to finance future cash needs\\nthrough public or private equity offerings, debt financings or corporate or government collaboration and licensing arrangements.\\nIf we do not succeed in raising additional funds on acceptable terms, we may be unable to complete existing nonclinical and planned\\nclinical trials or obtain approval of our product candidates from the FDA and other regulatory authorities. We expect capital\\noutlays and operating expenditures to increase over the next several years as we expand our infrastructure, and research and development\\nactivities. Specifically, we need to raise additional capital to, among other things:\\n\\n●\\nconduct\\n                                                                              preclinical research for our TerraCoV2 vaccine product candidate, file an IND with the FDA and, if approved, engage in Phase\\n                                                                              1 clinical trials;\\n\\n●\\nengage\\n    in GMP and non-GMP manufacturing for our product candidates at the preclinical research and clinical trial stages;\\n\\n●\\nexpand\\n    our clinical laboratory operations;\\n\\n●\\nfund\\n    our clinical validation study activities;\\n\\n●\\nexpand\\n    our research and development activities; and\\n\\n●\\nfinance\\n    our capital expenditures and general and administrative expenses.\\nOur\\npresent and future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including:\\n\\n●\\nthe\\n                                         current and continued microeconomic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our ability,\\n                                         the ability of our third-party contractors and suppliers to meet our development needs,\\n                                         and the ability of government regulators to conduct ordinary business operations in a\\n                                         timely and efficient manner, as well as the pandemic’s broader, macroeconomic impact\\n                                         on the U.S., foreign and global economic markets;\\n\\n●\\nthe\\n                                                                              level of research and development investment budgeted to develop our current and future product candidates through each phase\\n                                                                              of development;\\n\\n●\\ncosts\\n    of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights;\\n\\n●\\nour\\n    need or decision to acquire or license complementary technologies or acquire complementary businesses;\\n\\n●\\nchanges\\n    in test development plans needed to address any difficulties in product candidate selection for commercialization;\\n\\n●\\ncompeting\\n    technological and market developments;\\n\\n●\\nour\\n    interaction and relationship with the FDA, or other, regulatory agencies; and\\n\\n●\\nchanges\\n    in regulatory policies or laws that affect our operations.\\nAdditional\\ncapital may not be available on satisfactory terms, or at all. Furthermore, if we raise additional funds by issuing\\nequity securities, dilution to our existing stockholders could result. Any equity securities issued also may provide for rights,\\npreferences or privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. If we raise additional funds by issuing debt securities,\\nthese debt securities would have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock, and the terms\\nof the debt securities issued could impose significant restrictions on our operations. If we raise additional funds through collaborations\\nand licensing arrangements, we might be required to relinquish significant rights to our technologies or our products under development\\nor grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us, which could lower the economic value of those programs to us. If adequate\\nfunds are not available, we may have to scale back our operations or limit our research and development activities, which may\\ncause us to grow at a slower pace, or not at all, and our business could be adversely affected.S-10In\\naddition, we could be forced to discontinue product development and commercialization of one or more of our product candidates,\\ncurtail or forego sales and marketing efforts, and/or forego licensing attractive business opportunities.Risks\\nRelating to this OfferingThe\\nmarket price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be volatile and fluctuate significantly, which could result in\\nsubstantial losses for investors.The\\ntrading price for our common stock has been, and we expect it to continue to be, volatile. The price at which our common stock\\ntrades depends upon a number of factors, including our historical and anticipated operating results, our financial situation,\\nannouncements by us or our competitors, our ability or inability to raise the additional capital we may need and the terms on\\nwhich we raise it, and general market and economic conditions. Some of these factors are beyond our control. Broad market fluctuations\\nmay lower the market price of our common stock and affect the volume of trading in our stock, regardless of our financial condition,\\nresults of operations, business or prospects. The closing price of our common stock as reported on the NYSE American had a high\\nprice of $1.05 and a low price of $0.36 in the 52-week period ended December 31, 2019 and a high price of $1.49 and a low price\\nof $0.39 from January 1, 2020 through September 30, 2020. Among the factors that may cause the market price of our common stock\\nto fluctuate are the risks described in this “Risk Factors” section and other factors, including:\\n\\n●\\nresults\\n    of preclinical and clinical studies of our product candidates or those of our competitors;\\n\\n●\\nregulatory\\n    or legal developments in the U.S. and other countries, especially changes in laws and regulations applicable to our product\\n    candidates;\\n\\n●\\nactions\\n    taken by regulatory agencies with respect to our product candidates, clinical studies, manufacturing process or sales and\\n    marketing terms;\\n\\n●\\nintroductions\\n    and announcements of new products by us or our competitors, and the timing of these introductions or announcements;\\n\\n●\\nannouncements\\n    by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions or other strategic transactions or capital commitments;\\n\\n●\\nfluctuations\\n    in our quarterly operating results or the operating results of our competitors;\\n\\n●\\nvariance\\n    in our financial performance from the expectations of investors;\\n\\n●\\nchanges\\n    in the estimation of the future size and growth rate of our markets;\\n\\n●\\nchanges\\n    in accounting principles or changes in interpretations of existing principles, which could affect our financial results;\\n\\n●\\nfailure\\n    of our products to achieve or maintain market acceptance or commercial success;\\n\\n●\\nconditions\\n    and trends in the markets we serve;\\n\\n●\\nchanges\\n    in general economic, industry and market conditions;\\n\\n●\\nchanges\\n    in legislation or regulatory policies, practices or actions;\\nS-11\\n\\n●\\nthe\\n    commencement or outcome of litigation involving our company, our general industry or both;\\n\\n●\\nrecruitment\\n    or departure of key personnel;\\n\\n●\\nchanges\\n    in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of additional debt;\\n\\n●\\nactual\\n    or expected sales of our common stock by our stockholders;\\n\\n●\\nacquisitions\\n    and financings; and\\n\\n●\\nthe\\n    trading volume of our common stock.\\nIn\\naddition, the stock markets, in general, NYSE American and the market for biotech companies in particular, may experience a loss\\nof investor confidence. Such loss of investor confidence may result in extreme price and volume fluctuations in our common stock\\nthat are unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of our business, financial condition or results of operations.\\nThese broad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our common stock and expose us to securities class\\naction litigation. Such litigation, even if unsuccessful, could be costly to defend and divert management’s attention and\\nresources, which could further materially harm our financial condition and results of operations.If\\nyou purchase shares of our common stock sold in this offering, you will experience immediate and substantial dilution in the net\\ntangible book value of your shares. In addition, we may issue additional securities in the future, which may result in additional\\ndilution to investors.The\\noffering price per share of common stock in this offering is considerably more than the net tangible book value per share of our\\noutstanding common stock. As a result, investors purchasing shares of common stock in this offering will pay a price per share\\nthat substantially exceeds the value of our tangible assets after subtracting liabilities. Investors will incur immediate dilution\\nof $0.18 per share, based on the public offering price of $0.37 per share and the net tangible book value as of\\nSeptember 30, 2020. For a more detailed discussion of the foregoing, see the section entitled “Dilution” below. To\\nthe extent outstanding stock options and warrants are exercised, or convertible preferred stock converted, there will be further\\ndilution to new investors. In addition, to the extent we need to raise additional capital in the future and we issue additional\\nequity or convertible debt securities, our then existing shareholders may experience dilution and the new securities may have\\nrights senior to those of our common stock offered in this offering.Our\\nmanagement team may invest or spend the proceeds of this offering in ways with which you may not agree or in ways which may not\\nyield a significant return.Our\\nmanagement will have broad discretion over the use of proceeds from this offering. We intend to use the net proceeds from this\\noffering to fund of our Terra CoV-2 research and clinical trials for working capital and general corporate purposes. Our management\\nwill have considerable discretion in the application of the net proceeds, and you will not have the opportunity, as part of your\\ninvestment decision, to assess whether the proceeds are being used appropriately. The net proceeds may be used for corporate purposes\\nthat do not increase our operating results or enhance the value of our common stock.Future\\nsales of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to fall.The\\nmarket price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market,\\nor the perception that these sales could occur. In addition, these factors could make it more difficult for us to raise funds\\nthrough future offerings of common stock. We have recently issued a significant number of shares of common stock and the number\\nof outstanding shares has increased from 2,738,283 shares as of December 31, 2012 to 61,004,917 as of November 6, 2020. In addition,\\nthere were 16,017,133.483 shares of our Preferred stock outstanding which are convertible into shares of our common stock and\\nwarrants to purchase an additional 20,513,145 shares of our common stock issuable upon exercise of warrants to investors. There\\nwere also 5,801,349 shares issuable upon exercise of options outstanding and an additional 2,207,901 shares available for option\\ngrants under our 2012 Equity Incentive Plan.S-12The\\nissuance of shares of our common stock under our 2012 Equity Incentive Plan is covered by Form S-8 registration statements we\\nfiled with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, and upon exercise of the options, such shares may be resold into the\\nmarket. We have also issued shares of common stock and warrants in connection with previous private placements. Such shares are\\navailable for resale as well as certain of the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants. We have also issued\\nshares of our common stock in the private placement and financing transaction, which are deemed to be “restricted securities,”\\nas that term is defined in Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or Securities Act, and such shares\\nmay be resold pursuant to the provisions of Rule 144. For example, on June 30, 2016 we issued 904,568 restricted shares\\nof our common stock to three accredited investors (Precigen, the KFLP and our Chairman Dr. Telling) in a private placement. The\\nresale of shares acquired from us in private transactions could cause our stock price to decline significantly. In addition, the\\nconversion of outstanding shares of Series A and Series B convertible preferred stock issued in 2017 private placements into common\\nstock and the subsequent sale of shares of common stock could also cause our stock price to decline significantly.In\\naddition, from time to time, certain of our shareholders may be eligible to sell all or some of their restricted shares of common\\nstock by means of ordinary brokerage transactions in the open market pursuant to Rule 144, subject to certain limitations. In\\ngeneral, pursuant to Rule 144, after satisfying a six-month holding period: (i) affiliated shareholders, or shareholders whose\\nshares are aggregated, may, under certain circumstances, sell within any three-month period a number of securities which does\\nnot exceed the greater of 1% of the then-outstanding shares of common stock or the average weekly trading volume of the class\\nduring the four calendar weeks prior to such sale and (ii) non-affiliated shareholders may sell without such limitations, in each\\ncase provided we are current in our public reporting obligations. Rule 144 also permits the sale of securities by non-affiliates\\nthat have satisfied a one-year holding period without any limitation or restriction.We\\nare unable to estimate the number of shares that may be sold because this will depend on the market price for our common stock,\\nthe personal or business circumstances of sellers and other factors.We\\ncannot assure you that we will continue to be listed on the NYSE American.Our\\ncommon stock commenced trading on the NYSE American (formerly the NYSE MKT) on April 10, 2013, and we are subject to certain NYSE\\nAmerican continued listing requirements and standards. We may also incur costs that we have not previously incurred for expenses\\nfor compliance with the rules and requirements of the NYSE American. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to continue\\nto satisfy the requirements of the NYSE American’s continued listing standards.A\\ndelisting of our common stock from the NYSE American could negatively affect the price and liquidity of our common stock and could\\nimpair our ability to raise capital in the future.If\\nour common stock is not listed on a national securities exchange, U.S. holders of warrants may not be able to exercise their warrants\\nwithout compliance with applicable state securities laws and the value of your warrants may be significantly reduced.If\\nour common stock is delisted from the NYSE America and is not eligible to be listed on another national securities exchange, the\\nexercise of the warrants by U.S. holders may not be exempt from state securities laws. As a result, depending on the state of\\nresidence of a holder of the warrants, a U.S. holder may not be able to exercise its warrants unless we comply with any state\\nsecurities law requirements necessary to permit such exercise or an exemption applies. Although we plan to use our reasonable\\nefforts to assure that U.S. holders will be able to exercise their warrants under applicable state securities laws if no exemption\\nexists, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so. As a result, in the event that our common stock is delisted from\\nthe NYSE American and is not eligible to be listed on another securities exchange, your ability to exercise your warrants may\\nbe limited. The value of the warrants may be significantly reduced if U.S. holders are not able to exercise their warrants under\\napplicable state securities laws.S-13An\\ninvestment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. Before making any investment decision, you should carefully consider\\nthe risk factors set forth in this prospectus supplement, the accompanying prospectus and the information incorporated by reference\\nherein and therein, including under the caption “Risk Factors” in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and our\\nsubsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, which are incorporated by reference in this prospectus, as well as in any applicable\\nprospectus supplement, as updated by our subsequent filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange\\nAct”).These\\nrisks could materially affect our business, results of operation or financial condition and affect the value of our securities.\\nAdditional risks and uncertainties that are not yet identified may also materially harm our business, operating results and financial\\ncondition and could result in a complete loss of your investment. You could lose all or part of your investment. For more information,\\nsee “Where You Can Find More Information.”Risks Related\\nto This Offering Management\\nwill have broad discretion as to the use of the proceeds from this offering, and we may not use the proceeds effectively. Subject\\nto certain limited exceptions set forth in the offering documents, we have agreed to use the net proceeds from this offering solely\\nfor general corporate purposes. Our management will have significant flexibility in applying the net proceeds of this offering\\nfor general corporate purposes. You will be relying on the judgment of our management with regard to the use of these net proceeds,\\nand subject to any agreed upon contractual restrictions under the terms of the subscription agreements, you will not have the\\nopportunity, as part of your investment decision, to assess whether the proceeds are being used appropriately. It is possible\\nthat the net proceeds will be invested in a way that does not yield a favorable, or any, return for us. The failure of our management\\nto use such funds effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and\\ncash flow.You will\\nexperience immediate dilution in the book value per share of the common stock you purchase. Because\\nthe price per share of our Common Stock being offered is higher than the book value per share of our Common Stock, you will suffer\\nsubstantial dilution in the net tangible book value of the common stock you purchase in this offering. Based on the offering price\\nof $14.50 per Share, if you purchase the Shares offered in this offering, you will suffer immediate and substantial dilution per\\nShare in the net tangible book value of the common stock.There is\\nno public market for the warrants to purchase common stock in this offering. There\\nis no established public trading market for the Warrants being sold in this offering, and we do not expect a market to develop.\\nIn addition, we do not intend to apply to list the Warrants on any securities exchange. Without an active market, the liquidity\\nof the warrants will be limited.Future\\nsales or other dilution of our equity could depress the market price of our Common Stock.\\xa0Sales\\nof our Common Stock, preferred stock, warrants, debt securities or any combination of the foregoing in the public market, or the\\nperception that such sales could occur, could negatively impact the price of our Common Stock. We have a number of institutional\\nand individual shareholders that own significant blocks of our Common Stock. If one or more of these shareholders were to sell\\nlarge portions of their holdings in a relatively short time, for liquidity or other reasons, the prevailing market price of our\\nCommon Stock could be negatively affected.We\\nmay need to seek additional capital. If this additional financing is obtained through the issuance of equity securities, debt\\nconvertible into equity or options or warrants to acquire equity securities, our existing shareholders could experience significant\\ndilution upon the issuance, conversion or exercise of such securities.Holders\\nof the Warrants will have no rights as common stockholders until they acquire our Common Stock. Until\\nyou acquire shares of our Common Stock upon exercise of any of the Warrants, you will have no rights with respect to our Common\\nStock. Upon exercise of any Warrants held, you will be entitled to exercise the rights of a common stockholder only as to matters\\nfor which the record date occurs after the exercise date.Risks Related\\nto Our Business ProspectsThe\\nsuccessful development of our U.S. EV markets depends on various factors.On\\nAugust 18, 2020, our subsidary in U.S., Kandi America held a virtual launch event to introduce the K23 and K27 EVs into the U.S.\\nmarket. While it has received the required clearance from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for its two electric\\nvehicle (EV) models – the K23 and K27 – via Certificates of Conformity; the sale of such EVs into the U.S. market is\\nconditioned upon the satisfaction of the safety standards set by the United States Department of Transportation and the completion\\nof the feature modification, software and technology upgrades catering for our potentioal U.S. costomers. Thus, no units of electric\\nvehicles have been sold in the U.S.as of the date of this prospectus supplement. While we plan to apply a portion of our offering\\nproceeds into this segement, there is no assurance all conditions for the sale of EVs in the U.S. could be satisifed as planned.USE OF PROCEEDS\\nWe\\nestimate that the net proceeds we will receive from this offering will be $94,999,127, after deducting placement agent cash commission\\nand estimated offering expenses of approximately $200,900. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock issuable\\nupon exercise of the Warrants that we are offering unless and until such Warrants are exercised.If\\nall of the Warrants (warrants to purchase 3,805,312 Shares, including the Placement Agent warrant to purchase 265,487 Shares) issued\\nin connection with the closing are fully exercised for cash, we would receive additional aggregate proceeds of $55,177,024.We\\nintend to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes and working capital, including including research\\nand development and expenditures necessary to assure that our EV models comply with all necessary requirements for the entry into\\nthe U.S. market, general and administrative expenses, and potential ordinary course acquisitions of technologies that complement\\nour business. In the Securities Purchase Agreement we have entered into with the institutional investors in this offering, we have,\\nsubject to certain exceptions, specifically agreed not to use the proceeds of this offering to satisfy any existing debt (other\\nthan ordinary course trade payables), to redeem any of our outstanding securities, or to settle any litigation. We may segregate\\na small portion of the proceeds from this offering for the purpose of indemnification of the Placement Agent.We\\nhave not specifically identified the precise amounts we will spend on each of these areas or the timing of these expenditures.\\nThe amounts actually expended for each purpose may vary significantly depending upon numerous factors, including assessments of\\npotential market opportunities and competitive developments. In addition, expenditures may also depend on the establishment of\\nnew collaborative arrangements with other companies, the availability of other financing, and other factors. Subject to any agreed\\nupon contractual restrictions under the terms of the purchase agreement, our management will have some discretion in the application\\nof the net proceeds from this offering. Our stockholders may not agree with the manner in which our management chooses to allocate\\nand spend the net proceeds. Moreover, our management may use the net proceeds for purposes that may not result in our being profitable\\nor increase our market value.DESCRIPTION\\nOF THE SECURITIES In\\nthis offering, we are offering a 8,849,560 units, which consists of 8,849,560 Shares and Investors Warrants to purchase, in the\\naggregate, an additional 3,539,825 shares of our common stock.The\\nShares and Investors Warrants will be sold together as a unit consisting of one Share and a Warrant (to purchase 0.40 shares of\\nour common stock for each Share included in the unit).We\\nare offering the units at a purchase price of $11.30 per unit. Units will not be issued or certificated. The Shares and the Investors\\nWarrants are immediately separable and will be issued separately.This\\nprospectus supplement also relates to the offering of the Placement Agent Warrants and of the 265,487 shares of our common stock\\nissuable upon exercise, if any, of the Placement Agent Warrants.Common Stock\\nA\\ndescription of the Shares of Common Stock we are offering pursuant to this prospectus supplement is set forth under the heading\\n“Description of Common Stock,” starting on page 11 of the accompanying prospectus. As of November 19, 2020, we had\\n63,527,995 shares of outstanding Common Stock.Warrants The\\nmaterial terms and provisions of the Warrants being offered pursuant to this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus\\nare summarized below. The summary is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the form of warrant which will be provided\\nto each investor in this offering and will be filed as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC in connection with\\nthis offering.The\\nWarrants are exercisable for an aggregate of 3,805,312 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $14.50 per share. The Warrants\\nhave a term of 30 months from the date of issuance and are exercisable by the holders at any time after the date of issuance.The\\nexercise price and the number of shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants are subject to an adjustment upon the occurrence\\nof certain events, including, but not limited to, stock splits or dividends, business combinations, sale of assets, similar recapitalization\\ntransactions, or other similar transactions. The exercise price the Warrants are also subject to an adjustment in the event that\\nthe Company issues or is deemed to issue shares of Common Stock for less than the applicable exercise price of such Warrants. Furtheremore,\\nwithout the shareholders’ approval, the exercise price of the Investors Warrants shall not be adjusted to be lower than the\\naverage closing prices of the five trading days prior to November 20, 2020, or $10.08 (the “Minimum Price”) and the\\nCompany is prohibited from issuing any shares at a price lower than $10.08 except for the Excluded Securities, as such term is\\ndefined in the Investors Warrants, during the term of the Investors Warrants.Holders\\nof the Warrants may exercise their Warrants to purchase shares of our Common Stock by delivering an exercise notice, appropriately\\ncompleted and duly signed. Payment of the exercise price for the number of shares for which the warrant is being exercised is\\nrequired to be delivered within one trading day after exercise of a Warrant. In the event that the registration statement relating\\nto such warrant shares is not effective, a holder of warrants will have the right to exercise its Warrants for a net number of\\nwarrant shares pursuant to the cashless exercise procedures specified in the Warrants. The Warrants may be exercised in whole\\nor in part, and any portion of a warrant not exercised prior to the termination date shall be and become void and of no value.\\nThe absence of an effective registration statement or applicable exemption from registration does not alleviate our obligation\\nto deliver Common Stock issuable upon exercise of a Warrant.Upon\\nthe holder’s exercise of a Warrant, we will issue the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of such Warrant within\\ntwo trading days of our receipt of notice of exercise.Underlying\\nShares\\xa0The\\nshares of common stock issuable on exercise of the Warrants will be, when issued in accordance with the Warrants, duly and validly\\nauthorized, issued and fully paid and non-assessable.

(“Kandi Technologies”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on March\\n31, 2004. As used herein, the terms “Company” or “Kandi” refer to Kandi Technologies and its operating\\nsubsidiaries, as described below.Headquartered in Jinhua City, Zhejiang Province,\\nPeople’s Republic of China (“China” or “PRC”), the Company is one of China’s leading producers\\nand manufacturers of electric vehicle (“EV”) products (through Kandi Electric Vehicles Group Co., Ltd. (the “Affiliate\\nCompany”), formerly defined as the JV Company), EV parts, and off-road vehicles for sale in the Chinese and the global markets.\\nThe Company conducts its primary business operations through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Zhejiang Kandi Vehicles Co., Ltd. (“Kandi\\nVehicles”), Kandi Vehicles’ wholly and partially-owned subsidiaries, and SC Autosports LLC (“SC Autosports”,\\nd/b/a Kandi America).Our Organizational\\nStructureThe\\nCompany’s organizational chart as of the date of this registration statement is as follows:Industry OverviewOver\\nthe years, governments and the automobile manufacturing industry have reached a consensus on the importance of diversifying the\\nautomobile industry and utilizing various energy resources. China is one of the world’s largest automobile markets. China\\nhas relatively scarce fuel reserves but rich natural resources of electric power. As a result, the Chinese government has been\\nimplementing industrial policies of supporting new energy vehicles. The diversified market with the coexistence of traditional\\nfuel vehicles, plug-in hybrid vehicles and pure electric vehicles has been initially formed. We believe China is the most prospective\\nmarket for pure electric vehicles. According to a government forecast, China’s new energy vehicle sales are projected to\\ngrow to 2.1 million units in 2020, and its penetration is expected to reach 7% by 2020. We also believe that in the global automobile\\nindustry, there is great development space for the Chinese electric vehicle and core parts industry in the future.In\\nDecember 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (“COVID-19”), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus,\\nwas first found in Wuhan, China. The World Health Organization (“WHO”) declared the outbreak to be a Public Health\\nEmergency of International Concern on January 30, 2020 and recognized it as a pandemic on March 11, 2020. COVID-19 has had a significant\\nimpact on the global economy and many industries, including the automobile and parts industry. However, as the outbreak in China\\nhas been gradually managed under control, the automobile and parts industry has also begun to resume productions. Stimulated by\\nthe various preferential policies of the Chinese government to promote economic development, we believe the automobile and its\\nparts industry will return onto the track for the next development.As\\none of the pioneers in China’s electric vehicle industry, Kandi has spent years in the innovation of the new energy vehicle\\ntechnology research and development, production layout and market promotion mode, Kandi has successfully taken its position in\\nChina’s electric vehicle industry, especially in the areas of the production and manufacturing of electric vehicles and\\ncore parts.Competitive LandscapeIn\\ngeneral, our EV business faces competition from two groups of competitors: traditional vehicle manufacturers and new market entrants.In\\nterms of competition with conventional fuel vehicle manufacturers, many of the conventional fuel vehicle manufacturers are much\\nlarger in terms of size, manufacturing capabilities, customer bases, financial, marketing and human resources than the electric\\nvehicle manufacturers. However, the conventional fuel automobiles face many challenges, including but not limited to environmental\\npollution and energy scarcity, which in turn provide great opportunities for the rapid development of the EV industry in China.On\\nMarch 31, 2020, in order to promote automobile consumption, the executive meeting of the State Council decided to extend two preferential\\npolicies of new energy vehicle purchase subsidy and vehicle purchase tax exemption for another two years, which were originally\\ndue at the end 2020. The Chinese government has released various national policies to promote the high-quality development of\\nthe electric vehicle industry with goals to facilitate the transformation and upgrading of the automobile industry, to improve\\nthe comprehensive competitiveness of the electric vehicle industry, to support the electric vehicle and its core parts industry,\\nto accelerate the resumption of production, and to promote the automobile consumption to cope with the impact of COVID-19 on the\\nnational economy.Our Opportunities\\nand Growth StrategyLocal\\ngovernments in China are pushing for new electric vehicle adoption with strong policy support, due to worsening air pollution\\nand concerns about petroleum resource dependence. As one of the beneficiaries of the new energy vehicle industry take-off, Kandi\\nhas become one of the front runners in China’s electric vehicle industry, given its technology innovation with integrated\\nsolutions and operation experience.Our\\nbusiness strategy includes efforts to provide customers with high-quality products, to expand our footprint in new and existing\\nmarkets, and to advance our profile and the market demand through the further innovations in the Car- Share Program and the Affiliate\\nCompany’s direct sales channel. We also provide EV products to end users through our distributors. We anticipate that our\\npure EV product business in China, through the operations of the Affiliate Company and with the support of new Chinese government\\npolicies (including the Double Credit System Policy), will continue to develop and grow in the future. China promulgated the Double\\nCredit System Policy in 2017, which assesses carmakers in terms of both fuel consumption and new energy vehicle production. We\\ncan amass credits by producing gasoline vehicles with less emissions than the country’s standards or by producing electric\\ncars, plug-in hybrids and fuel cell vehicles.Today, cities in China face four critical\\nchallenges in the traffic environment, including pollution, traffic congestion, insufficient parking availability, and growing\\nscarcity of energy supplies, which are mainly the result of ever-growing volume of gas-powered private cars. The best solution\\nto these problems is to increase more affordable public transportation for urban residents. Subway and bus used to be the most\\npopular public transportation options in China. They form the main artery of urban public transportation, but such system is lack\\nof capillary. In this regard, we introduced the Car-Share Program by using pure electric vehicles. Urban public transportation\\nsystem can be improved with the Online Ride Sharing Service (“ORSS”) program.In order to further improve the Car-Share\\nProgram, we united other operators in more than 10 cities to form of a five-year 300,000 units online ride-sharing service alliance\\nat the beginning of 2019. As one of the most active practitioners of sharing economy model in China nowadays, this innovative\\nbusiness model provides an excellent solution to EV sharing. The character of this program is that all the cars casted to the\\nonline platform by the alliance use the changing-battery-model. The changing battery model solves the problems including high\\nprice of EVs, short recharging mileage, long recharging time, shortage of charging facilities, battery attenuation and potential\\npollution problem and so on. Furthermore, this model allows the battery to be slowly recharged at a constant temperature, which\\nprolongs the usage life of the battery and truly realize green energy efficiency. We have reason to believe that this upgrade\\nto ORSS program from Micro Public Transportation, or MPT advocated and practiced by Kandi will become the benchmark of urban car-share\\nand play a significant role in the development of China’s urban travel ecosphere.SC Autosports, LLC (“SC Autosports”,\\nd/b/a Kandi America) is a Dallas-based sales company with nationwide sales channels in the U.S that is primarily engaged in the\\nwholesale of off-road vehicle products, with a small percentage of its business derived from off-road vehicle parts wholesale and\\nretail. It has a seasoned management team and a distribution force averaging over ten years of sales experience. To gain access\\nto and promote electric vehicle products to the U.S. market, on July 1, 2018, we acquired 100% ownership of SC Autosports. Through\\nmore than one year’s preparation, SC Autosports is to begin to sell Kandi’s electric vehicles in the U.S. market this\\nyear.On\\nMarch 21, 2019, Zhejiang Kandi Vehicles Co., Ltd. (“Kandi Vehicles”) signed an Equity Transfer Agreement with Geely\\nTechnologies Group Co., Ltd. (“Geely”) to transfer certain equity interests in the Kandi Electric Vehicles Group Co.,\\nLtd. (the “Affiliate Company”, formerly defined as the “JV Company”) to Geely.

The term “business combination” includes mergers, asset or stock sales and other similar\\ntransactions resulting in a financial benefit to an interested stockholder. Section 203 makes it more difficult for an “interested\\nstockholder” to effect various business combinations with a corporation for a three-year period. The existence of this provision\\nwould be expected to have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by our board of directors,\\nincluding discouraging attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares of common stock held by stockholders.\\nPresently, we have not opted out of this provision.DESCRIPTION\\nOF PREFERRED STOCKAs\\nof October 16, 2020, no shares of preferred stock had been issued or were outstanding.Our\\nboard of directors has the authority to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to determine\\nthe rights and preferences of the shares of any such series without stockholder approval. Our board of directors may issue preferred\\nstock in one or more series and has the authority to fix the designation and powers, rights and preferences and the qualifications,\\nlimitations or restrictions with respect to each class or series of such class without further vote or action by the stockholders,\\nunless action is required by applicable law or the rules of any stock exchange on which our securities may be listed. The ability\\nof our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval could have the effect of delaying, deferring or\\npreventing a change of control of us or the removal of existing management. Further, our board of director may authorize the issuance\\nof preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders\\nof our common stock. Additionally, the issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of decreasing the market price of our common\\nstock.We\\nwill file as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part, or will incorporate by reference from\\nreports that we file with the SEC, the form of any certificate of designation that describes the terms of the series of preferred\\nstock we are offering before the issuance of that series of preferred stock.

Before you decide to invest, we recommend that you carefully consider the following\\nrisk factors. Risks Relating to Economic Conditions and Other Factors \\n\\nAdverse events arising from the global Coronavirus outbreak could result in delays in payment or losses on your notes.\\n The current outbreak of a new strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) has spread\\nthroughout the world, including in the United States. The outbreak has been declared to be a public health\\xa0emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization, and the\\xa0president of the United States has made an emergency\\ndeclaration under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act.\\xa0A significant number of countries and the majority of state governments in the United States have also made emergency declarations related to the outbreak\\nand have attempted to slow community spread of the virus by providing social distancing guidelines, issuing stay-at-home orders and mandating the closure of certain non-essential businesses. The outbreak has led, and will likely continue to lead, to disruptions in global financial markets and the economies of many nations and is resulting in adverse impacts on the economy of\\nthe United States (which include a general reduction in business activity and a significant increase in unemployment) and the global economy in general.\\nThe long-term impacts of the social, economic and financial disruptions caused by the outbreak of COVID-19 are\\nunknown.\\xa0While the U.S. Federal Reserve has implemented emergency interest rate cuts and liquidity programs for businesses and financial markets and the United States government and other governments have implemented other measures and stimulus\\nplans in response to concerns surrounding the economic effects of the outbreak, the likelihood of such measures calming the volatility in the financial markets or preventing the occurrence of a longer-term national or global economic downturn cannot\\nbe predicted.\\xa0The United States economy has entered into a recession as a result of the outbreak and it is unclear how prolonged or severe this recession will be or how many\\xa0lessees have been and will continue to be adversely affected by\\nthe outbreak and related efforts by the Federal government and state governments to slow the spread of COVID-19 throughout the nation. In many jurisdictions, automotive dealers were required (or elected) to\\ntemporarily close or restrict their operations, and, even for dealerships that remained open or have subsequently reopened, consumer demand for automobiles has declined. As a result, VW Credit experienced and continues to experience a decline in the\\norigination of auto leases. As discussed under “—Recent economic developments may adversely affect the performance of the leases, which could result in losses on your notes,” these occurrences could have a negative impact on\\nthe ability of lessees to meet their payment obligations under the leases and may result in increased losses on the notes.\\nAdditionally, the continued spread of COVID-19 may ultimately result in staffing problems in various industries and\\nbusinesses if staff members become ill or seek to avoid becoming ill as various governmental authorities have urged non-essential employees to stay home. Many businesses are reviewing and adjusting their\\nbusiness continuity plans (or have implemented their business continuity plans) to change how and from where their staff members work in light of the outbreak. Those staffing problems and adjustments could cause changes in historical lessee\\nbehavior, potentially resulting in less timely payments on the leases or delayed or\\n\\n reduced demand for the related vehicles. Consequently, the ability of VW Credit, as sponsor and servicer, or the other transaction parties,\\nto perform their respective obligations under the transaction documents could be diminished by regulatory actions related to the outbreak and disruptions in the economy and the financial markets. The economic and operational impact of the outbreak\\ncould adversely affect the business of VW Credit as discussed under “—Adverse events with respect to VW Credit or its affiliates or third party providers to whom VW Credit outsources its activities could affect the timing of payments on\\nyour notes or have other adverse effects on your notes”. Further, certain\\ngovernmental authorities, including Federal, state or local governments, could enact, and in some cases already have enacted, laws, regulations, executive orders or other guidance that allow lessees to defer scheduled payments, require modifications\\nto the leases, or preclude creditors from exercising certain rights or taking certain actions with respect to collateral, including repossession or liquidation of the leased vehicles. It is unclear how many lessees have been and will continue to be\\nadversely affected by the outbreak and whether related efforts by the Federal, state and local governments will be effective in mitigating the spread of COVID-19 throughout the nation. To the extent the\\ncurrent economic downturn results in increased delinquencies and defaults by lessees on the leases due to financial hardship or otherwise, the servicer may implement a range of actions with respect to affected lessees and the related leases to\\nextend or modify the payment terms on the leases consistent with the servicer’s customary servicing practices. Across the nation, servicers of motor vehicle leases, including VW Credit, experienced an increase in the requests for deferrals by\\nlessees related to COVID-19 and a significant number of such deferrals have been granted, including by VW Credit. Beginning in March 2020, VW Credit implemented the\\nCOVID-19 Customer Assistance Program to assist customers impacted by COVID-19. Lessees requesting relief under the COVID-19\\nCustomer Assistance Program during the period beginning on March\\xa012, 2020 and ending on June\\xa028, 2020 were offered a three month retail payment deferral with no fees and no minimum number of payments required. Lessees requesting relief\\nunder the COVID-19 Customer Assistance Program during the period beginning on June\\xa029, 2020 and ending on September\\xa010, 2020, were offered a second payment deferral on a case by case basis. As of\\nSeptember\\xa011, 2020, customer relief under the COVID-19 Customer Assistance Program was no longer available. Although the frequency of requests for deferrals has recently declined, a worsening of the COVID-19 outbreak and a resurgence of widespread stay-at-home orders may occur at any time, which could again lead to a sharp increase\\nin requests from lessees for deferrals related to COVID-19 or general economic hardship and a reinstatement of the COVID-19 Customer Assistance Program or a similar\\nprogram. There is no guarantee that a deferral granted by the servicer will prevent a future default by a lessee. Any lease for which the servicer’s records as of the cutoff date indicate that the related lessee received a deferral related to COVID-19 has been excluded from the pool of leases allocated to the Transaction SUBI.\\nFurther, many motor vehicle finance companies, including VW Credit, temporarily suspended involuntary repossession activity nationwide as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. In March 2020, VW Credit temporarily suspended all repossession activities in all 50 states in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Only essential recoveries\\n(where allowed by law) continued to occur, which included impounded vehicles, customer\\n\\n surrenders and fraud vehicles. VW Credit has resumed involuntary repossession activity where permitted by local law, but may elect (or be\\nrequired) to again suspend such activity at any time in the future. The reduction in the repossession rate related to the COVID-19 outbreak and the general limited availability of used car auctions and other\\nmarkets for the sale of repossessed vehicles have generally resulted in delays and/or decreases in recoveries for non-performing leases. Consequently, if a leased vehicle is repossessed while the used car\\nauction market is not fully functioning, it is likely that the sale proceeds for such leased vehicle will be lower than expected, resulting in increased losses that may result in losses on your notes.\\nBecause a pandemic such as COVID-19 has not\\noccurred in recent years, historical loss experience is unlikely to accurately predict the performance of the leases allocated to the Transaction SUBI. See “—Credit scores and historical loss experience may not accurately predict the\\nlikelihood of losses on the leases” below. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects the United States economy, including the ability of lessees to meet their payment obligations under the leases, financial markets or the business or operations of the sponsor or\\nthe servicer, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section, such as those related to the ability of lessees to meet their payment obligations under the leases, used\\nvehicle values, the performance, market value, credit ratings and secondary market liquidity of your notes, and risks of geographic concentration of the lessees. All of the foregoing could have a negative impact on the performance of the leases and,\\nas a result, you may experience delays in payments or losses on your notes.\\n\\nRecent economic developments may adversely affect the performance of the leases, which could result in losses on your notes.\\n A deterioration in economic conditions could adversely affect the ability and willingness of lessees to meet their payment obligations under\\nthe leases. Economic conditions could deteriorate in connection with an economic recession or due to events such as reduced business activity, high unemployment, volatile interest rates, rising or falling oil prices, housing price declines, lack of\\navailable credit, the rate of inflation and consumer perceptions of the economy, as well as other factors, such as terrorist events, civil unrest, public health emergencies or extreme weather conditions or an increase of lessees’ payment\\nobligations under other indebtedness incurred by the lessees. The issuing entity’s ability to make payments on the notes could be adversely affected if lessees were unable to make timely payments or if the servicer elected to, or was required\\nto, implement forbearance programs in connection with lessees suffering a hardship (including hardships related to the outbreak of COVID-19).\\nThe United States has entered into a recession of unknown length and severity, which\\nmay adversely affect the performance of the leases and the performance and market value of your notes. See “—Adverse events arising from the global Coronavirus outbreak could result in delays in payment or losses on your notes”\\nabove. Periods of economic slowdown or recession are often characterized by high unemployment and diminished availability of credit, generally resulting in increases in delinquencies, defaults and losses on automobile leases and repossessions of the\\nrelated leased vehicles, as well as decreased consumer demand for automobiles and reduced vehicle prices, which may increase the amount of a loss in the event of a default by a lessee. See “—The residual value of leased vehicles may be\\nadversely \\n\\n affected by discount pricing incentives, marketing incentive programs and economic developments” below. Motor vehicle finance\\ncompanies, including VW Credit, and banks experienced a sharp increase in delinquencies and/or requests for deferrals related to COVID-19 and a significant number of such deferrals have been granted, including\\nby VW Credit. Although the frequency of requests for deferrals has recently declined, a worsening of the COVID-19 outbreak and a resurgence of widespread stay-at-home orders may occur at any time, which could again lead to a sharp increase in requests from lessees for deferrals related to COVID-19 or general economic\\nhardship. Further, periods of economic slowdown may also be accompanied by\\ndecreased consumer demand for automobiles, increased turn-in rates and declining market values of off-lease vehicles, which could increase the amount of a loss in the\\nevent of a default by a lessee. Significant increases in the inventory of used automobiles during periods of economic slowdown or recession may also depress the prices at which repossessed and off-lease\\nautomobiles may be sold or delay the timing of these sales. Vehicle sales and other activity in the consumer automotive market sharply declined following the COVID-19 outbreak and may decline again in the\\nfuture, especially if directives requiring stay-at-home orders and the closure of “nonessential” businesses in an effort to slow the COVID-19 outbreak continue for a prolonged period of time or are re-implemented.\\nIf an economic downturn is experienced for a prolonged period of time, it is expected that delinquencies, defaults and repossessions will increase and that\\nlosses on the leases could increase, which could result in losses on your notes. It is possible that a higher percentage of lessees will seek protection under bankruptcy or debtor relief laws as a result of financial and economic disruptions related\\nto the COVID-19 pandemic than is reflected in VW Credit’s historical experience. See “—Adverse events arising from the global Coronavirus outbreak could result in delays in payment or losses\\non your notes” above. Additionally, an improvement in economic conditions could result in prepayments by the lessees of their payment obligations under the leases. As a result, you may receive principal payments of your notes earlier than\\nanticipated. Further, the market values of the related leased vehicles could increase or decrease based on economic conditions.\\nNo prediction or assurance can be made as to the effect of an economic downturn or economic growth on the rate of delinquencies, prepayments and/or losses on\\nthe leases, and all of these factors could result in losses on your notes.\\n\\nThe geographic concentration of the lessees in the pool of leases and related leased vehicles and varying economic circumstances may increase the risk of losses or reduce the return on your notes.\\nThe concentration of the leases in specific geographic areas may increase the risk of loss. A deterioration in economic conditions in the states where lessees reside, including those caused by the\\nCOVID-19 pandemic, and the related governmental responses to such economic conditions (such as repossession or creditors’ rights moratoriums), could adversely affect the ability and willingness of lessees\\nto meet their payment obligations under the leases and the ability to sell or dispose of the related vehicles for an amount at least equal to their Automotive Lease Guide residual values, and may consequently affect the delinquency, loss and\\nrepossession experience of the issuing entity with respect to the leases and related leased vehicles in such states. As a result, you may experience payment delays or losses on your notes. An improvement in economic conditions could result in\\nprepayments by the lessees of their payment obligations under the leases.\\n\\n As a result, you may receive principal payments of your notes earlier than anticipated. No prediction can be made and no assurance can be\\ngiven as to the effect of the current economic downturn or any future economic growth or further economic decline on the rate of delinquencies, prepayments and/or losses on the leases. See “—Returns on your investments may be reduced by\\nprepayments on the leases, events of default, optional redemption of the notes or reallocations of the leases and leased vehicles from the Transaction SUBI” below. As of the cutoff date, based on the state of origination of the leases\\n(based on the address of the lessee), 18.90%, 13.51%, 13.29%, 8.64% and 6.44% of the aggregate securitization value of the related leases and leased vehicles were located in California, New York, Florida, New Jersey and Texas, respectively. No other\\nstate accounts for more than 5.00% of the aggregate securitization value of the pool of leases and leased vehicles as of the cutoff date. Due to the recent economic downturn with respect to the oil and gas industry resulting from the decline in oil\\nprices, leases located in the state of Texas may experience higher delinquencies or defaults than in prior securitizations. Management believes that there are no other factors unique to any state or region in which 10% or more of the aggregate\\nsecuritization value of the leases and leased vehicles are located that may materially impact the issuing entity’s ability to pay principal and interest on the notes. Economic factors such as unemployment, interest rates, the price of gasoline,\\nthe rate of inflation and consumer perceptions of the economy may affect the rate of prepayments and defaults on the leases. Further, the effect of natural disasters, such as pandemics, hurricanes, wildfires and floods, on the performance of the\\nleases, is unclear, but there may be a significant adverse effect on general economic conditions, consumer confidence and general market liquidity.\\nBecause of the concentration of the leases in certain states, any adverse economic conditions, natural disasters or other factors affecting these states in\\nparticular, including disruptions caused by COVID-19, may have a greater effect on the performance of the notes than if the concentration did not exist.\\n\\nThe return on your notes could be reduced by shortfalls due to extreme weather conditions, natural disasters and public health concerns.\\nExtreme weather conditions and public health concerns (including the COVID-19 pandemic) could cause substantial business disruptions, economic losses, unemployment and/or an economic downturn.\\nAs a result, the related lessees’ ability to meet their payment obligations under the leases could be adversely affected. The issuing entity’s ability to make payments on the notes could be adversely affected if the related lessees were\\nunable to make timely payments.\\n\\nRisks Relating to the Leases, the Lessees and the Related Leased Vehicles\\n\\nThe concentration of leased vehicles to particular models could negatively affect the issuing entity’s assets.\\nThe Tiguan, Q5 and Jetta models represent approximately 19.14%, 17.81% and 10.15% of the aggregate securitization value, respectively, of the related leases allocated to the Transaction SUBI as of the cutoff date. No other model\\naccounts for more than 10.00% of the aggregate securitization value of the pool of leases and leased vehicles as of the cutoff date. Any adverse change in the value of a specific model type would reduce the proceeds received at disposition of a\\nrelated leased vehicle. As a result, you may incur a loss on your investment.\\n\\nCredit scores and historical loss experience may not accurately predict the likelihood of losses on the leases.\\nInformation regarding credit scores for the lessees obtained at the time of origination of the related lease is presented in “The Leases—Representations, Warranties and Covenants—Eligibility Criteria and\\n\\n\\n Portfolio Characteristics” in this prospectus. A credit score purports only to be a measurement of the relative degree of risk a\\nborrower represents to a lender, i.e., that a borrower with a higher score is statistically expected to be less likely to default in payment than a borrower with a lower score. Further, credit score models were built prior to the global outbreak of COVID-19, and consequently, were not designed to take into account the social, economic and financial disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Neither the depositor, the\\nsponsor nor any other party makes any representations or warranties as to any lessee’s current credit score or the actual performance of any lease or that a particular credit score should be relied upon as a basis for an expectation that a\\nlease will be paid in accordance with its terms. Additionally, historical loss and\\ndelinquency information set forth in this prospectus under “Prepayments, Delinquencies, Repossessions and Net Losses—Delinquency, Repossession and Loss Data” was affected by several variables, including general economic\\nconditions and market residual values, that are expected to differ in the immediate future, and are likely to differ in the longer term future, in particular due to the current economic downturn in the United States arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. Delinquencies and losses with respect to leases generally have trended higher during periods of economic uncertainty, and these negative trends may continue. Therefore, there can be no assurance\\nthat the future delinquency or net loss experience calculated and presented in this prospectus with respect to VW Credit’s managed portfolio of leases will reflect actual experience with respect to the leases allocated to the Transaction\\nSUBI. The servicer experienced a sharp increase in requests for deferrals\\nnationwide following the start of the COVID-19 outbreak and a significant number of such deferrals have been granted. Further, the servicer temporarily suspended involuntary repossession activities nationwide\\nas a result of the COVID-19 outbreak and temporarily modified its customary servicing practices to address other collections activity for COVID-19 affected customers and\\nin jurisdictions in which the market for the sale of used cars was disrupted as a result of stay-at-home orders and similar directives. The servicer has resumed\\ninvoluntary repossessions and other collections activities where permitted by local law, but may elect (or be required) to again suspend such activity, or otherwise modify its customary servicing practices, at any time in the future.\\nThe COVID-19 outbreak is impacting lessees\\nnationwide and is expected to have a materially more significant impact on VW Credit’s managed portfolio of leases (including the performance of the leases allocated to the Transaction SUBI) than even the most severe historical natural\\ndisasters during the years reflected in the historical loss and delinquency information set forth in this prospectus. As a result, investors should expect increased delinquencies on the leases and potentially higher losses on the leases, and such\\nincreases could be substantial. Consequently, payments on the notes could be adversely affected.\\n\\nThe residual value of leased vehicles may be adversely affected by discount pricing incentives, marketing incentive programs and economic developments.\\nHistorical residual value loss experience on leased vehicles is partially attributable to new vehicles pricing policies of all manufacturers. Discount pricing incentives or other marketing incentive programs on new vehicles by VW\\nCredit or by its competitors that effectively reduce the prices of new vehicles may have the effect of reducing demand by consumers for used\\n\\n vehicles. Although VW Credit currently does not have any marketing incentive program that reduces the prices of new vehicles, it may\\nintroduce such programs in the future. The residual value published in\\nAutomotive Lease Guide for a leased vehicle and the stated residual value for a leased vehicle are only estimates, and are not guarantees of the residual value of a leased vehicle. The reduced demand for used vehicles resulting from discount\\npricing incentives or other marketing incentive programs introduced by VW Credit or any of its competitors may reduce the prices consumers will be willing to pay for used vehicles, including leased vehicles included in the pool assets at the end of\\nthe related leases and thus reduce the residual value of such leased vehicles.\\nSignificant increases in the inventory of used vehicles during periods of economic slowdown or recession may also depress the prices at which off-lease vehicles may be sold or delay the timing of these sales. Furthermore, specific models and vehicle types may experience a greater than anticipated decline in the residual value and used vehicle prices under\\ncertain market conditions. As a result of these factors, the proceeds received by\\nthe origination trust upon disposition of leased vehicles may be reduced and may not be sufficient to pay amounts owing on the notes.\\n\\nUsed vehicle market factors may increase the risk of loss on your investment.\\nThe prices for used vehicles declined significantly at the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, but have since recovered. Used vehicle prices could significantly decline again if the COVID-19 outbreak worsens.\\xa0The used vehicle market is affected by supply and demand for those vehicles, which, in turn, is affected by consumer tastes, economic factors and conditions, fuel costs, legislation\\nrelating to emissions and fuel efficiency, manufacturer decisions on introduction and pricing of new vehicle models, the volume of vehicles whose lease terms are expiring and other factors, including the impact of vehicle recalls or the\\ndiscontinuation of vehicle models or brands.\\xa0For instance, introduction of a new model by Volkswagen AG or its affiliates may impact the resale value of the existing portfolio of similar model types.\\xa0Discount pricing incentives or other\\nmarketing incentive programs on new vehicles by Volkswagen AG or by its competitors that effectively reduce the prices of new vehicles may have the effect of reducing demand by consumers for used vehicles.\\xa0Other factors that are beyond the\\ncontrol of the issuing entity, the depositor and the servicer could also have a negative impact on the resale value of a vehicle. For example, the imposition of increased tariffs on imported vehicles may also affect the pricing and availability of\\nboth new and used vehicles. If programs are implemented by the United States government to stimulate the sale of new vehicles, this may have the effect of further reducing the values of used vehicles, resulting in increased losses that may result in\\nlosses on your notes. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has influenced the supply of new and used vehicles. Initially stay at home orders restricted activity in the used vehicle market. This reduced supply\\nof new and, as a consequence used vehicles, led to an increase in the value of used vehicles. Further COVID restrictions could impair the servicer’s ability to liquidate leased vehicles, which may adversely impact the resale value for returned\\nor repossessed leased vehicles and/or cause substantial delays in leased vehicle liquidations. Increased vehicle inventories may result from new vehicle supply returning, lease extensions returning and increased repossessions, which could adversely\\naffect resale values. Economic factors will influence\\n\\nthe affordability of used vehicles. Customer behavior may evolve with working from home arrangements, including the risk that working from home reduces the demand for vehicle purchases. All of these factors could have a negative\\nimpact on the resale value of a vehicle. If the proceeds actually realized upon the sale of the leased vehicles are substantially lower than the residual values originally established by VW Credit, you may suffer a loss on your investment.\\n\\nIncreased turn-in rates may increase losses.\\nUnder each lease, the lessee may elect to purchase the related vehicle at the expiration of the lease for an amount generally equal to the stated residual value established at the inception of the lease. Lessees who decide not to\\npurchase their related vehicles at lease expiration will expose the issuing entity to possible losses if the sale prices of those vehicles in the used vehicle market are less than their respective stated residual values. The level of turn-ins at termination of the leases could be adversely affected by the convenience of the turn-in process generally (including as a result of temporary modifications to the\\nlease turn-in process implemented in response to COVID-19), lessee views on vehicle quality, the relative attractiveness of new models available to the lessees, sales\\nand lease incentives offered with respect to other vehicles (including those offered by VW Credit), the level of the purchase option prices for the related vehicles compared to new and used vehicle prices and economic conditions generally. The grant\\nof deferrals, extensions and the early termination of leases by lessees may affect the number of turn-ins in a particular month. If losses resulting from increased\\nturn-ins exceed the credit enhancement for the notes, you may suffer a loss on your investment.\\n\\nYou may experience a loss if defaults on the leases or residual losses exceed the available credit enhancement.\\n The issuing entity does not have, nor is it permitted or expected to have, any significant assets or sources of funds other than the related\\nTransaction SUBI Certificate, together with available funds in the collection account and the reserve account. The notes represent obligations solely of the issuing entity and will not be insured or guaranteed by any entity. Accordingly, you will\\nrely primarily upon collections on the leases and the related leased vehicles allocated to the Transaction SUBI owned by the issuing entity and amounts on deposit in the collection account and the reserve account. Funds on deposit in the reserve\\naccount will cover shortfalls due to delinquencies on the leases and losses on the leases and leased vehicles up to the amount on deposit therein. However, if delinquencies and losses create shortfalls which exceed the available credit enhancement,\\nyou may experience delays in payments due to you and you could suffer a loss. You will have no claim to any amounts properly distributed to the depositor or others from time to time.\\nIn establishing the stated residual value of leased vehicles, VW Credit uses an\\ninternally developed proprietary model. There is no guarantee that the assumptions regarding future events that are used to determine residual values will prove to be correct. If the stated residual values of the leased vehicles as originally\\ndetermined by VW Credit are substantially higher than the sales proceeds actually realized upon the sale of the leased vehicles, you may suffer losses if the available credit enhancement for your notes is exceeded.\\nFor a discussion of factors that may contribute to residual value losses, you should\\nrefer to “—Used vehicle market factors may increase the risk of loss on your investment,” “—Increased turn-in rates may increase losses”, “—The\\nconcentration of leased vehicles to particular models could negatively \\n\\naffect the issuing entity’s assets”, “—The geographic concentration of the lessees in the pool of leases and related leased vehicles and varying economic circumstances may increase the risk of losses or\\nreduce the return on your notes” and “The Sponsor—Determination of Residual Values” in this prospectus.\\n\\nInadequate insurance on leased vehicles may cause losses on your investment.\\n Each lease requires the lessee to maintain insurance covering physical damage to the leased vehicle with the origination trust named as a\\nloss payee. The lessees select their own insurers to provide the required coverage, so the specific terms and conditions of their insurance policies vary.\\nAlthough the sponsor typically assures that the lessee’s insurance requirement is satisfied at the inception of a lease, neither the sponsor nor the\\nservicer is obligated to monitor whether a lessee continues to satisfy its insurance requirement during the term of the lease. In the event insurance coverage is not maintained by lessees, then insurance recoveries may not be available in the event\\nof losses or damages to leased vehicles included in the pool, and you could suffer a loss on your investment.\\n\\nVehicle recalls may have an adverse effect on the leases and your notes.\\n From time to time, automobile manufacturers or their suppliers may discover an element in a vehicle which might possibly affect the safety or\\nother features of the vehicle, including compliance with applicable safety or emissions standards. In such cases the manufacturer in consultation with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration may recall the affected vehicles for repair or\\nother necessary service. In certain cases, a recall may give rise to the lessee having the right to rescind or terminate its contract or an obligation of the related vehicle manufacturer to repurchase the related recalled vehicle. In addition,\\nrecalls or other service campaigns could cause a temporary suspension of sales of the affected vehicles until completion of any necessary repairs, which may cause a delay of the timing of the sales of returned or repossessed vehicles in the used\\nvehicle markets. Recalls or other service campaigns, including as a result of the failure of a particular model to comply with applicable safety or emissions standards, may also cause a decrease in demand for the affected vehicles in the used\\nvehicle market, which may cause a decline in values of those vehicles. Declines in values of used vehicles could cause an increase in credit losses. If any of these events materially affect collections on the leases securing your notes, you may\\nexperience delays in payments or principal losses on your notes if the available credit enhancement has been exhausted.\\nVolkswagen Group of America is recalling certain Audi Q7 crossovers from the 2018-20 model years built between July\\n2017 and April 2020 in the U.S. because the deformation element on the C-pillar may not have been properly manufactured and this will cause a noncompliance issue with NHTSA’s FMVSS 201. Dealers and\\ncustomers will be notified on or before November\\xa030, 2020 and the deformation element on the driver and passenger side C-pillar will be replaced free of charge. The recall campaign began on\\nNovember\\xa013, 2020. Sales of the affected vehicles are not permitted until completion of any necessary repairs. As of the cutoff date, 1,947 leases, representing approximately 7.66% of the aggregate securitization value of the leases allocated\\nto the Transaction SUBI as of the cutoff date, are subject to the recall.\\n\\n\\n Risks Relating to the Sponsor and Servicer\\n\\n\\nAdverse legal or regulatory developments with respect to VW Credit or its affiliates could have an adverse effect on your notes.\\n The sponsor and its affiliates (including Volkswagen AG, the sponsor’s ultimate parent) are party to, or are periodically otherwise\\ninvolved in, reviews, investigations, examinations and proceedings (both formal and informal), and information-gathering requests, by government and self-regulatory agencies, including the CFPB, the DOJ, the SEC, and various state authorities.\\nExaminations can include various focal points, such as fair lending, servicing of accounts, and evaluations of compliance management systems. The findings of these examinations may result in the repurchase of leases. See “The\\nSponsor—Recent Developments—Legal and Regulatory.” Volkswagen AG\\nis party to other legal actions and investigations in and outside the United States, and further regulatory proceedings, environmental, consumer, product-related and investor claims could be raised against Volkswagen AG in the future in various\\njurisdictions worldwide. These proceedings and actions and publicity surrounding them could have an adverse effect on your notes, even in circumstances where neither we nor the sponsor is a party to or otherwise involved in the proceedings or other\\nactions. For example, regulatory and legal actions against Volkswagen AG, Volkswagen Group of America, Inc. (“Volkswagen Group of America”), the sponsor or other affiliates of the sponsor related to the manufacture and\\nsale of affected vehicles may result in reputational damage to Volkswagen AG and Volkswagen Group of America, as well as to the “Volkswagen” and “Audi” brands.\\xa0The pricing of used vehicles is affected by the supply and\\ndemand for those vehicles. If the demand for used Volkswagen or Audi vehicles decreases as a result of the issues arising after the Notices of Violation (as defined under “The Sponsor—Recent Developments—Legal and\\nRegulatory”), related regulatory or legal actions or other factors, the resale value of the leased vehicles may also decrease. Further, these and any other reviews, investigations, examinations and proceedings (whether formal or informal)\\nand/or information-gathering requests that the sponsor or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates are involved in, or may become involved in, may result in adverse consequences to the sponsor including, without limitation, adverse judgments,\\nsettlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, or other actions and may affect the ability of the sponsor or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates to perform its duties under the transaction documents.\\n\\nAdverse events with respect to VW Credit or its affiliates or third party providers to whom VW Credit outsources its activities could affect the timing of payments on your notes or have other adverse effects on your\\nnotes.\\nAdverse events with respect to VW Credit or any of its affiliates or a third party provider to whom VW Credit outsources its activities could result in servicing disruptions or reduce the market value of your notes. For example,\\nservicing disruptions could result from unanticipated events beyond VW Credit’s control, such as natural disasters, civil unrest, public health emergencies (including COVID-19 or similar outbreaks) and\\neconomic disruptions, particularly to the extent such events affected VW Credit’s business or operations. For example, if significant portions of VW Credit’s workforce are unable to work effectively as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including because of illness, stay-at-home orders, facility closures or ineffective remote work arrangements, there\\nmay be servicing disruptions, which could result in reduced collection effectiveness. Further, certain third-parties that VW Credit relies on to deliver products and services to support their business have recently indicated that they may be unable\\nto fully perform in a timely manner and similar notifications may be received in the near future, which could adversely impact VW Credit’s ability to operate its business or perform its obligations under\\nthe\\n\\n transaction documents or could cause a disruption in collection activities with respect to the leases and related leased vehicles allocated\\nto the Transaction SUBI. See “—Adverse events arising from the global Coronavirus outbreak could result in delays in payment or losses on your notes.” In addition, in the event of a termination and replacement of VW Credit as\\nthe servicer, there may be some disruption of the collection activity with respect to delinquent leases and therefore delinquencies and credit losses could increase. Similarly, if VW Credit becomes unable to repurchase the beneficial interest in any\\nleases and related leased vehicles which do not comply with representations and warranties about the leases made by VW Credit in the SUBI sale agreement, then investors could suffer losses. In addition, adverse corporate developments with respect to\\nservicers of asset-backed securities or their affiliates have in some cases also resulted in a reduction in the market value of the related asset-backed securities. For example, VW Credit is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Volkswagen AG.\\nAlthough Volkswagen AG is not guaranteeing the obligations of the issuing entity, if Volkswagen AG ceased to manufacture vehicles or support the sale of vehicles or if Volkswagen AG faced financial or operational difficulties or issued recall\\nnotices with respect to vehicles it manufactured, such events may reduce the market value of the notes and/or reduce the market value of Volkswagen and Audi vehicles, and ultimately the amount realized on any Volkswagen or Audi leased vehicle,\\nincluding the leased vehicles allocated to the Transaction SUBI. Further, VW Credit\\nrelies upon its ability to sell securities in the asset backed securities market and upon its ability to access various credit facilities to fund its operations. As discussed under “—Adverse events arising from the global Coronavirus\\noutbreak could result in delays in payment or losses on your notes,” the global credit and financial markets have recently experienced, and may continue to experience, significant disruption and volatility. Recent government and regulatory\\nactions may not be successful in mitigating the adverse economic effects of COVID-19. Sustained adverse economic effects from the pandemic may also result in downgrades in the credit ratings of VW Credit or\\nadversely affect the interest rate environment. VW Credit cannot predict how the COVID-19 outbreak and the legal and regulatory responses to the COVID-19 outbreak and\\nrelated economic disruptions will continue to affect its businesses, including its liquidity or the ability to access the capital markets. If VW Credit’s access to funding is reduced or if its costs to obtain such funding significantly\\nincreases, its business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected which could adversely affect its ability to perform its obligations under the transaction documents.\\n\\nThe servicer’s commingling of funds with its own funds could result in a loss.\\nSubject to the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth under “Description of the Transaction Documents—The Accounts—The Collection Account”, VW Credit, as the servicer, may be able to commingle funds\\nrelating to this transaction such as security deposits, collections from the leases and proceeds from the disposition of the related leased vehicles with its own funds during each collection period and may be able to make a single deposit to the\\ncollection account on each payment date. See “Description of the Transaction Documents—The Accounts—The Collection Account” in this prospectus. Commingled funds may be used or invested by the servicer at its own risk and\\nfor its own benefit. If the servicer were unable to remit such funds or the servicer were to become a debtor under any insolvency laws, delays or reductions in distributions to you may occur. In addition,\\nif\\n\\nthe servicer failed to remit to the lessees the required portions of their security deposits at the expiration of their leases, the origination trust could be held liable for those portions of the security deposits, and investors in\\nthe notes could incur a loss on their investment as a result.\\n\\nThe servicer’s discretion over the servicing of the leases may impact the amount and timing of funds available to make payments on the notes.\\n The servicer is obligated to service the leases and related leased vehicles in accordance with its customary practices. The servicer has\\ndiscretion in servicing the leases and the related leased vehicles, including the ability to grant payment extensions and to determine the timing and method of collection and liquidation procedures. The servicer, in its own discretion, may permit an\\nextension on, or a deferral of, lease payments due or halt repossession activity on a\\xa0case-by-case\\xa0basis or more broadly in accordance with its customary\\nservicing practices, for example, in connection with a natural disaster or public health emergency affecting a large group of lessees. The servicer experienced a sharp increase in requests for deferrals related\\nto\\xa0COVID-19\\xa0nationwide and a significant number of such deferrals have been granted. However, there is no guarantee that a deferral granted by the servicer will prevent a future default by a lessee.\\nFurther, as a result of the\\xa0COVID-19\\xa0outbreak, the servicer temporarily suspended involuntary repossession activities nationwide and temporarily modified its customary servicing practices to address\\nother collections activity for\\xa0COVID-19\\xa0affected customers and in jurisdictions in which the market for the sale of used cars was disrupted as a result of\\xa0stay-at-home\\xa0orders and similar directives. The servicer has resumed involuntary repossessions and other collections activity where permitted by local law, but may elect (or be required) to again\\nsuspend such activity at any time in the future. See “—Adverse events arising from the global Coronavirus outbreak could result in delays in payment or losses on your notes.”\\nPayment extensions, other modifications to the leases or delays in initiating\\nrepossession activity may extend the maturity of the leases, increase the weighted average life of any class of notes and reduce the yield on your notes. Further, absent a breach of an eligibility representation or warranty (but only if such breach\\nis not cured and materially and adversely affects the interests of the issuing entity or the noteholders) or a breach of a servicing covenant specifically requiring reallocation, VW Credit will have no obligation to repurchase the beneficial\\ninterest in any lease or related leased vehicle for which the related lessee was adversely affected by the outbreak of COVID-19 (including in the event the related lease is extended or modified after the\\ncutoff date). See “Description of the Transaction Documents—Representations and Warranties” and “The Servicer— Extensions, Deferrals and Pull-Aheads” in this prospectus.\\nIn addition, the servicer’s customary practices may change from time to time and\\nthose changes could reduce collections on the leases and related leased vehicles. Although the servicer’s customary practices at any time will apply to all vehicles and leases held by the origination trust, without regard to whether a vehicle\\nand related lease has been allocated to a securitization transaction, the servicer is not obligated to maximize collections from the leases and related leased vehicles. Consequently, the manner in which the servicer exercises its servicing\\ndiscretion or changes its customary practices could have an impact on the amount and timing of collections on the leases and the related leased vehicles, which may impact the amount and timing of funds available to make payments on the\\nnotes.\\n\\n\\n Risks Relating to Material Legal Aspects\\n\\n\\nThe origination trust may not have a perfected interest in leases evidenced by electronic contracts.\\n The servicer, on behalf of the origination trust, has contracted with a third-party to originate and maintain custody of certain of the\\ncontracts in electronic form through the third-party custodian’s technology system. The third-party custodian’s technology system is designed to enable the origination trust to perfect its interest in the leases evidenced by electronic\\nrecords by satisfying the Uniform Commercial Code’s requirements for “control” of electronic chattel paper. In order for the origination trust to have “control” of an item of electronic chattel paper, (a)\\xa0there must be\\na “single authoritative copy” of the electronic record or records comprising such electronic chattel paper that is readily distinguishable from all other copies and which identifies the origination trust as the assignee of the chattel\\npaper, (b)\\xa0all other copies of the electronic chattel paper must indicate that they are not the “authoritative copy” of the electronic chattel paper, (c)\\xa0any revisions to the authoritative copy of the electronic chattel paper\\nmust be readily identifiable as either authorized or unauthorized revisions and (d)\\xa0authorized revisions of the electronic chattel paper cannot be made without the participation of the origination trust.\\nHowever, another person could acquire an interest in an electronic contract that is\\nsuperior to the interest of the origination trust (and accordingly the issuing entity’s interest), if (a)\\xa0the origination trust ceases to have “control” over the items of electronic chattel paper that are maintained on behalf of\\nthe origination trust by the third-party custodian and (b)\\xa0another party acquires ownership or a collateral security interest in the electronic chattel paper and perfects its security interest either by filing a financing statement or taking\\n“control” over the electronic chattel paper. The origination trust could also lose “control” over an electronic contract if through fraud, forgery, negligence or error, or as a result of a computer virus or a failure of or\\nweakness in the third-party custodian’s technology system a person other than the origination trust were able to modify or duplicate the authoritative copy of the contract.\\nAlthough the origination trust’s interest in the electronic contracts has been\\nperfected by filing financing statements, the fact that the origination trust’s interest in the electronic contracts may not be perfected by “control” may affect the priority of the origination trust’s interest in such leases.\\nFor example, the issuing entity’s interest in the leases could be junior to another party with a prior perfected security interest in the inventory of the originating dealer, which security interest would attach to the leases as proceeds of the\\ninventory. There can be no assurances that the third-party’s technology system\\nwill perform as represented to the servicer in maintaining the systems and controls required to provide assurance that the origination trust maintains “control” over an electronic contract. In that event, there may be delays in obtaining\\ncopies of the electronic contract or confirming ownership and “control” of the electronic contract.\\n\\nInterests of other persons in the leases and the leased vehicles could be superior to the issuing entity’s interest, which may result in delayed or reduced payment on your notes.\\nBecause the Transaction SUBI will represent a beneficial interest in the Transaction SUBI assets, you will be dependent on payments made on the leases allocated to the Transaction SUBI and proceeds received in connection with the\\nsale or other disposition of the related leased vehicles for payments on your notes. The issuing entity will not have a direct ownership interest in the leases or a direct ownership interest or\\nperfected\\n\\n security interest in the related leased vehicles, which will be titled in the name of the origination trust or the origination trustee on\\nbehalf of the origination trust. It is therefore possible that a claim against or lien on the leased vehicles or the other assets of the origination trust could limit the amounts payable in respect of the Transaction SUBI Certificate to less than\\nthe amounts received from the lessees of the leased vehicles or received from the sale or other disposition of the leased vehicles.\\nFurther, liens in favor of and/or enforceable by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation could attach to the leases and leased vehicles owned by the\\norigination trust (including the leases and the leased vehicles allocated to the Transaction SUBI) and could be used to satisfy unfunded ERISA obligations of any member of a controlled group that includes VW Credit and its affiliates. Because these\\nliens could attach directly to the leases and leased vehicles allocated to the Transaction SUBI and because the issuing entity does not have a prior perfected security interest in the assets of the Transaction SUBI, these liens could have priority\\nover the interest of the issuing entity in the assets of the Transaction SUBI. See “—If ERISA liens are placed on the origination trust assets, you could suffer a loss” in this prospectus.\\nTo the extent a third party makes a claim against, or files a lien on, the assets of\\nthe origination trust, including the leased vehicles allocated to the Transaction SUBI, it may delay the disposition of those leased vehicles or reduce the amount paid to the issuing entity, as holder of the Transaction SUBI Certificate. If that\\noccurs, you may experience delays in payment or losses on your investment. For more\\ninformation on the effect of third-party claims or liens on payment of the notes, you should refer to “Additional Legal Aspects of the Origination Trust and the Transaction SUBI—Allocation of Origination Trust Liabilities” in\\nthis prospectus.\\n\\nIf ERISA liens are placed on the origination trust assets, you could suffer a loss.\\n Liens in favor of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation could attach to the leases and leased vehicles owned by the origination trust\\n(including the leases and the leased vehicles allocated to the Transaction SUBI) and could be used to satisfy unfunded pension obligations of any member of a controlled group that includes VW Credit and its affiliates which has unfunded pension\\nliabilities under its defined benefit pension plans. Because these liens could attach directly to the leases and leased vehicles and because the issuing entity does not have a prior perfected security interest in the assets included in a Transaction\\nSUBI, these liens could have priority over the interest of the issuing entity in the assets included in the Transaction SUBI.\\nFrom time to time, the rating agencies rating your notes may request information with respect to any defined benefit pension plans maintained or sponsored by\\nVW Credit or any of its affiliates. Although VW Credit will use reasonable efforts to comply with such request, there is no assurance that VW Credit will be able to provide the requested information. Any rating downgrade could result in a decline in\\nthe market value of your notes.\\n\\nA depositor or sponsor bankruptcy could delay or limit payments to you.\\nFollowing a bankruptcy or insolvency of the sponsor or the depositor, a court could conclude that the Transaction SUBI Certificate is owned by the sponsor or the depositor, instead of the issuing entity. This conclusion could be\\neither because the transfer of that Transaction SUBI Certificate\\n\\n from VW Credit to the depositor or from the depositor to the issuing entity was not a true sale or because the court concluded that the\\ndepositor or the issuing entity should be treated as the same entity as VW Credit or the depositor for bankruptcy purposes. VW Credit will not treat the sale of the Transaction SUBI to the depositor as a sale for generally accepted accounting\\nprinciple purposes, and this fact could make a court more likely to reach that conclusion than if such sale were treated as a sale by VW Credit for generally accepted accounting principle purposes. If this were to occur, you could experience delays\\nin payments due to you or you may not ultimately receive all amounts due to you as a result of:\\n•\\u2003\\u2002\\u200athe automatic stay, which prevents a secured creditor from exercising remedies against a\\ndebtor in bankruptcy without permission from the court, and provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code that permit substitution of collateral in limited circumstances;\\n•\\u2003\\u2002\\u200atax or government liens on the sponsor’s or depositor’s property (that arose\\nprior to the transfer of the Transaction SUBI Certificate to the issuing entity) having a prior claim on collections before the collections are used to make payments on the notes; or\\n•\\u2003\\u2002\\u200athe fact that neither\\nthe issuing entity nor the indenture trustee has a perfected security interest in the leases and leased vehicles allocated to the Transaction SUBI and may not have a perfected security interest in any cash collections of the leases and leased\\nvehicles allocated to the Transaction SUBI held by the servicer at the time that a bankruptcy proceeding begins.\\nFor a discussion of how a bankruptcy proceeding of the sponsor or the depositor may affect the issuing entity and the notes, you should refer to\\n“Additional Legal Aspects of the Origination Trust and the Transaction SUBI—Insolvency Related Matters” in this prospectus.\\n\\nVicarious tort liability may result in a loss.\\n Some states allow a party that incurs an injury involving a vehicle to sue the owner of the vehicle merely because of that ownership. As\\nowner of the vehicles, the origination trust may be subject to these lawsuits. Most, but not all, states, however, either prohibit these vicarious liability suits against leasing companies or limit the lessor’s liability to the amount of\\nliability insurance that the lessee was required to carry under applicable law but failed to maintain.\\nOn August\\xa010, 2005, President George W. Bush signed into law the Safe Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient Transportation Equity Act of 2005 (the\\n“Transportation Act”), Pub. L. No.\\xa0109-59. The Transportation Act provides that an owner of a motor vehicle that rents or leases the vehicle to a person will not be liable under the law\\nof a state or political subdivision by reason of being the owner of the vehicle, for harm to persons or property that results or arises out of the use, operation, or possession of the vehicle during the period of the rental or lease, if (i)\\xa0the\\nowner (or an affiliate of the owner) is engaged in the trade or business of renting or leasing motor vehicles; and (ii)\\xa0there is no negligence or criminal wrongdoing on the part of the owner (or an affiliate of the owner). This provision of the\\nTransportation Act was effective upon enactment and applies to any action commenced on or after August\\xa010, 2005. The Transportation Act is intended to preempt state and local laws that impose possible vicarious tort liability on entities owning\\nmotor vehicles that are rented or leased and it is\\n\\n expected that the Transportation Act should reduce the likelihood of vicarious liability being imposed on the origination trust. State and\\nfederal courts considering whether the Transportation Act preempts state laws permitting vicarious liability have generally concluded that such laws are preempted with respect to cases commenced on or after August\\xa010, 2005. While the vast\\nmajority of courts have concluded that the Transportation Act preempts state laws permitting vicarious liability, one New York lower court has reached a contrary conclusion in a case involving a leasing trust. This New York court concluded that the\\npreemption provision in the Transportation Act was an unconstitutional exercise of congressional authority under the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution and, therefore, did not preempt New York law regarding vicarious liability. New\\nYork’s appellate court overruled the trial court and upheld the constitutionality of the preemption provision in the Transportation Act. New York’s highest court, the Court of Appeals, dismissed the appeal. In a 2008 decision relating to a\\ncase in Florida, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit upheld the constitutionality of the Transportation Act, and the plaintiffs’ petition seeking review of the decision by the U.S. Supreme Court was denied. In 2010, a similar\\ndecision was issued by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit. While the outcome in these cases upheld federal preemption under the Transportation Act, the outcome of cases that are pending in other jurisdictions and their impact are\\nuncertain at this time. The servicer will be required to maintain liability\\ninsurance coverage on behalf of the origination trust. However, this coverage is subject to deductibles and claims could be imposed against the assets of the origination trust which could exceed that coverage. In the event the servicer fails to\\nmaintain this liability insurance coverage, the deductible is not satisfied or the insurance coverage protecting the origination trust is insufficient to cover, or does not cover, a material claim, that claim could be satisfied out of the proceeds\\nof the leased vehicles and leases allocated to the Transaction SUBI and you could incur a loss on your investment.\\nFor a discussion of the possible liability of the origination trust in connection with the use or operation of the leased vehicles, you should refer to\\n“Material Legal Aspects of the Leases and the Leased Vehicles—Vicarious Tort Liability” in this prospectus.\\n\\n Regulatory Risk Factors\\n\\n\\nFederal and state financial regulatory reform could have a significant impact on the servicer, the sponsor, the depositor or the issuing entity and could adversely affect the timing and amount of payments on your notes.\\n On July\\xa021, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) was enacted.\\nAlthough the Dodd-Frank Act itself took effect on July\\xa022, 2010, many of its provisions had delayed implementation dates or required implementing regulations to be issued. A number of these implementing regulations still have not been issued.\\nThe Dodd-Frank Act is extensive and significant legislation that, among other things:\\n•\\u2003\\u2002\\u200acreated a framework for the liquidation of certain bank holding companies and other nonbank\\nfinancial companies, determined to be “covered financial companies”, in the event such a company is in default or in danger of default and the resolution of such a company under other applicable law would have serious adverse effects on\\nfinancial stability in the United States, and also for the liquidation of certain of their respective subsidiaries, defined as “covered subsidiaries”, in the event\\n\\n such a subsidiary also determined to be a “covered financial company” because it is, among other things, in default or in danger\\nof default and the liquidation of such subsidiary would avoid or mitigate serious adverse effects on the financial stability or economic conditions of the United States;\\n•\\u2003\\u2002\\u200acreated a new framework for the regulation of over-the-counter derivatives activities;\\n•\\u2003\\u2002\\u200aexpanded the regulatory oversight of securities and capital markets activities by the SEC;\\nand •\\u2003\\u2002\\u200acreated the\\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”), an agency responsible for, among other things, administering and enforcing the laws and regulations for consumer financial products and services and conducting examinations of large\\nbanks and their affiliates for purposes of assessing compliance with the requirements of consumer financial laws.\\nThe CFPB has supervisory, examination and enforcement authority over certain non-depository institutions, including\\nthose entities that are larger participants of a market for consumer financial products or services as defined by the rule. As of August\\xa031, 2015 VW Credit is subject to the CFPB’s supervision with respect to VW Credit’s compliance\\nwith applicable consumer protection laws. In May 2019, the CFPB issued a proposed\\nrule governing the activities of third-party debt collectors.\\xa0While the proposed rule did not address first-party debt collectors, the CFPB has previously indicated that it would address this activity in a later rulemaking.\\xa0It is unclear\\nwhat changes will be included in any final debt collection rules issued\\xa0by the CFPB and what effect, if any, such changes would have on the leases or the servicer’s practices, procedures and other servicing activities relating to the\\nleases in ways that could reduce the associated recoveries. The Dodd-Frank Act also\\nincreased the regulation of the securitization markets. For example, it gives broader powers to the SEC to regulate credit rating agencies and adopt regulations governing these organizations and their activities.\\nCompliance with the implementing regulations under the Dodd-Frank Act or the oversight\\nof the SEC, CFPB or other government entities, as applicable, may impose costs on, create operational constraints for, or place limits on pricing with respect to finance companies such as VW Credit. Because of the complexity of the Dodd-Frank Act,\\nthe ultimate impact and its effects on the financial markets and their participants will not be fully known for an extended period of time. In particular, no assurance can be given that these new requirements imposed, or to be imposed after\\nimplementing regulations are issued, by the Dodd-Frank Act will not have a significant impact on the servicing of the leases, and on the regulation and supervision of the servicer, the sponsor, the administrator, the depositor, the issuing entity\\nand/or their respective affiliates. In addition, no assurances can be given that\\nthe framework for the liquidation of “covered financial companies” or their “covered subsidiaries” would not apply to VW Credit or its affiliates, including the issuing\\nentity\\n\\n and the depositor, or, if it were to apply, would not result in a repudiation of any of the transaction documents where further performance\\nis required or an automatic stay or similar power preventing the indenture trustee or other transaction parties from exercising their rights. This repudiation power could also affect the transfer of the Transaction SUBI Certificate as further\\ndescribed under “Additional Legal Aspects of the Origination Trust and the Transaction SUBI—Dodd-Frank Orderly Liquidation Framework—FDIC’s Repudiation Power under OLA” in this prospectus. Application of this\\nframework could materially adversely affect the timing and amount of payments of principal and interest on your notes. Furthermore, on May\\xa024, 2018, President Trump signed into law the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection\\nAct, which repealed or amended certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. See “Additional Legal Aspects of the Origination Trust and the Transaction SUBI—Dodd-Frank Orderly Liquidation Framework” in this prospectus.\\nOn March\\xa025, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the\\n“CARES Act”) was signed into law. The CARES Act is extensive and significant legislation, and the majority of implementing regulations have not yet been issued. The potential impact of the CARES Act on VW Credit and its affiliates\\nor on the lessees of the leases in the pool is not yet known. It is possible that compliance with the implementing regulations under the CARES Act may impose costs on, or create operational constraints for, VW Credit and may have an adverse impact\\non the ability of VW Credit to effectively service the leases. Further, certain governmental authorities, including Federal, state or local governments, could enact, and in some cases already have enacted, laws, regulations, executive orders or\\nother guidance that allow lessees to defer scheduled payments, require modifications to the leases (e.g., waiving accrued interest), preclude creditors from exercising certain rights or taking certain actions with respect to collateral, including\\nrepossession or liquidation of the financed vehicles or mandate limited operations or temporary closures of the servicer or its vendors as “non-essential businesses” or otherwise.\\nThe CARES Act provided for the creation of the Federal Pandemic Unemployment\\nCompensation program, which provided an additional $600 per week to individuals collecting traditional unemployment compensation. This benefit was available for weeks of unemployment ending on or before July\\xa031, 2020. The President of the\\nUnited States has since authorized a similar benefit, at a reduced level, as well as a deferral of certain payroll tax collections through the end of 2020. However, VW Credit cannot predict the impact of the reduced unemployment benefit or the\\nfailure by Congress to renew or initiate other relief measures. In addition, it is not known how many lessees may have been receiving any such additional unemployment benefits, or what the effect of any reduction of such benefits may be on the\\nability of the lessees to meet their payment obligations under the leases allocated to the Transaction SUBI.\\n\\nFailure to comply with consumer protection laws could result in a loss.\\nFederal and state consumer protection laws, including the federal Consumer Leasing Act of 1976 and Regulation M promulgated by the CFPB regulate the creation, collection and enforcement of retail lease contracts such as the leases.\\nAdditionally, the CARES Act includes various provisions, such as new requirements affecting credit reporting, designed to protect consumers. However, the majority of implementing regulations under the CARES Act have not yet been issued. Although the\\nliability of the issuing entity to the lessee for violations of applicable federal and state consumer laws may be\\n\\n limited, these laws may make an assignee of a lease, such as the origination trust, liable to the lessee for any violation by the lender.\\nUnder certain circumstances, the liability of the origination trust to the lessee for violations of applicable federal and state consumer protection laws may be limited by the applicable law. In some cases, this liability could affect an\\nassignee’s ability to enforce its rights related to the leases. The failure by the origination trust to comply with applicable law may give rise to liabilities on the part of the origination trust or the issuing entity (as owner of the\\nTransaction SUBI). Further, many states have adopted “lemon laws”\\nthat provide vehicle users certain rights in respect of substandard vehicles. A successful claim under a lemon law could result in, among other things, the termination of the related lease and/or the requirement that a portion of payment previously\\npaid by the lessee be refunded. VW Credit will represent and warrant that each lease complies with applicable law in all material respects as of the cutoff date. If that representation and warranty relating to any lease allocated to the Transaction\\nSUBI proves incorrect, materially and adversely affects the interests of the issuing entity or the noteholders and is not timely cured, VW Credit will be required to repurchase the beneficial interest in the noncompliant lease and related leased\\nvehicle from the issuing entity. To the extent that VW Credit fails to make such a repurchase, or to the extent that a court holds the origination trust or the issuing entity liable for violating consumer protection laws regardless of such a\\nrepurchase, a failure to comply with consumer protection laws could result in required payments by the origination trust or the issuing entity. If sufficient funds are not available to make both payments to lessees and on your notes, you may suffer\\na loss on your investment in the notes. For a discussion of federal and state\\nconsumer protection laws which may affect the leases, you should refer to “Material Legal Aspects of the Leases and the Leased Vehicles—Consumer Protection Laws” in this prospectus.\\n\\nChanges to federal or state bankruptcy or debtor relief laws may impede collection efforts or alter the timing and amount of collections, which may result in acceleration of or reduction in payment on your notes.\\nIf a lessee sought protection under federal or state bankruptcy or debtor relief laws, a court could reduce or discharge completely the lessee’s obligations to repay amounts due on its lease. As a result, that lease would be\\nwritten off as uncollectible. It is likely that a higher percentage of lessees will seek protection under bankruptcy or debtor relief laws as a result of financial and economic disruptions related to the outbreak of\\nCOVID-19 than is reflected in the sponsor’s historical experience. See “—Credit scores and historical loss experience may not accurately predict the likelihood of losses on the\\nleases.” You could suffer a loss if no funds are available from credit enhancement or other sources and finance charge amounts allocated to the notes are insufficient to cover the applicable default amount.\\n\\nExit of the United Kingdom from the European Union may adversely affect the performance of the leases and could result in losses or delays in payments or losses on your notes.\\n The UK ceased to be a member of the EU on January\\xa031, 2020 (such withdrawal from the EU being commonly referred to as\\n“Brexit”). This withdrawal took place in accordance with a withdrawal agreement, which provides for the Transition Period. During the Transition Period, EU law continues to apply to and in the UK, any reference to “member\\nstates” in such EU law shall be understood as including the UK and the UK will continue to have access to the EU single market.\\nThe UK and the EU have commenced negotiations with regard to the terms of their future relationship. There remains considerable uncertainty surrounding how\\nsuch negotiations may develop and whether they will have\\n\\n a negative impact on the UK, on the broader global economy and on the value of the British pound. The future effects of Brexit will in large\\npart be dependent on the outcome of these negotiations between the UK and the EU and the extent to which the UK retains access to EU markets at the end of the Transition Period.\\nFollowing the conclusion of the Transition Period the UK will no longer be considered a\\n“member state” of the EU and EU law will no longer apply to and in the UK. There is therefore uncertainty as to the scope, nature and terms of the relationship between the UK and the EU that will apply after the end of the Transition\\nPeriod. The political, legal and regulatory uncertainty surrounding the possibility that no agreement is reached by the end of the Transition Period, or as regards the terms of the future relationship between the UK and the EU if an agreement is\\nreached, has raised concerns that Brexit could adversely affect economic and market conditions in the UK, in the EU and elsewhere, and could introduce potentially significant uncertainty and instability in global financial markets.\\nThe results of these events may significantly impact the volatility, liquidity and/or\\nmarket value of securities and other financial instruments, including the notes.\\n\\nRequirements for certain European regulated investors and affiliates.\\n The EU Securitization Regulation is directly applicable in member states of the EU and will be applicable in any non-EU states of the EEA in which it is implemented. Notwithstanding the UK’s withdrawal from the EU on January\\xa031, 2020, the EU Securitization Regulation also continues to apply in the UK following such\\ndate until December\\xa031, 2020 under the terms of the withdrawal agreement negotiated between the EU and the UK (the “Transition Period”); but it is currently expected that, with effect from the end of the Transition Period, the\\nEU Securitization Regulation will cease to be applicable in the UK and certain similar UK legislation will take effect.\\nArticle 5 of the EU Securitization Regulation places certain conditions (the “EU Due Diligence Requirements”) on investments in, or other\\nexposures to, “securitisations” (as defined in the EU Securitization Regulation) by “institutional investors”, defined to include (a)\\xa0a credit institution or an investment firm as defined in and for purposes of Regulation\\n(EU) No 575/2013, as amended, known as the Capital Requirements Regulation (the “CRR”), (b) an insurance undertaking or a reinsurance undertaking as defined in Directive 2009/138/EC, as amended, known as Solvency II, (c)\\xa0an\\nalternative investment fund manager as defined in Directive 2011/61/EU that manages and/or markets alternative investment funds in the EU or (during the Transition Period) the UK, (d)\\xa0an undertaking for collective investment in transferable\\nsecurities (“UCITS”) management company, as defined in Directive 2009/65/EC, as amended, known as the UCITS Directive, or an internally managed UCITS, which is an investment company that is authorized in accordance with that\\nDirective and has not designated such a management company for its management, and (e)\\xa0with certain exceptions, an institution for occupational retirement provision falling within the scope of Directive (EU) 2016/2341, or an investment manager\\nor an authorized entity appointed by such an institution for occupational retirement provision as provided in that Directive. Pursuant to Article 14 of the CRR, the EU Due Diligence Requirements also apply to investments by certain consolidated\\naffiliates, wherever established or located, of institutions regulated under the CRR (such affiliates, together\\n\\n with all institutional investors, the “Affected Investors”).\\nPursuant to the EU Due Diligence Requirements, an Affected Investor investing in a\\nsecuritization must, amongst other things, verify (a)\\xa0that the originator, sponsor or original lender retains a material net economic interest of not less than 5% in such securitization in accordance with the EU Securitization Regulation,\\n(b)\\xa0that the originator, sponsor or issuer has, where applicable, made available information as required by the EU Securitization Regulation, and (c)\\xa0that certain credit-granting requirements are satisfied.\\nAlthough VW Credit will retain credit risk in accordance with Regulation RR as\\ndescribed in this prospectus under “The Sponsor—Credit Risk Retention”, none of VW Credit, the depositor, the underwriters, any of their affiliates or any other party to the transaction described in this prospectus will\\n(a)\\xa0retain or commit to retain a 5% material net economic interest with respect to this transaction in accordance with the EU Securitization Regulation or (b)\\xa0take or refrain from taking any action to facilitate or enable compliance by any\\nperson with the EU Due Diligence Requirements, or with the requirements of any other law or regulation now or hereafter in effect in the EU, any EEA member state or the UK, in relation to risk retention, due diligence and monitoring, credit granting\\nstandards or any other conditions with respect to investments in securitization transactions.\\nFailure by an Affected Investor to comply with the EU Due Diligence Requirements with respect to an investment in the Notes may result in the imposition of a\\npenalty regulatory capital charge on such investment or of other regulatory sanctions by the competent authority of such Affected Investor. Consequently, the notes may not be a suitable investment for Affected Investors, and this may affect the\\nprice and liquidity of the notes. Prospective investors are responsible for\\nanalyzing their own regulatory position and should consult with their own investment and legal advisors regarding the application of the EU Securitization Regulation or other applicable regulations and the suitability of the Notes for\\ninvestment.\\n\\n Risks Relating to the Notes\\n\\n\\n\\nRetention of some or all of one or more classes of notes by the depositor or an affiliate of the depositor may reduce the liquidity of such notes.\\nSome or all of one or more classes of notes may be retained or purchased by the depositor or an affiliate of the depositor. Accordingly, the market for such a retained class of notes may be less liquid than would otherwise be the\\ncase. In addition, if any retained notes are subsequently sold in the secondary market, demand and market price for notes of that class already in the market could be adversely affected. Additionally, if any retained notes are subsequently sold in\\nthe secondary market, the voting power of the noteholders of the outstanding notes may be diluted.\\n\\nThe failure to make principal payments on any notes will generally not result in an indenture default until the applicable final scheduled payment date.\\nThe amount of principal required to be paid on a note prior to the applicable final scheduled payment date generally will be limited to amounts available for those purposes. Therefore, the failure to pay principal of a note\\ngenerally will not result in an indenture default until the final scheduled payment date for the applicable notes.\\n\\nVW Credit, the servicer and the depositor have limited obligations to the issuing entity and will not make \\nVW Credit, the servicer, the depositor and their affiliates are not obligated to make any payments to you on your notes. However, VW Credit will make representations and warranties about certain characteristics of\\nthe\\n\\npayments on the notes.\\n leases and leased vehicles allocated to the related Transaction SUBI.\\nIf a representation or warranty made by VW Credit is untrue, then VW Credit may be\\nrequired to repurchase the beneficial interest in that lease and the related leased vehicle. In addition, in some circumstances, the servicer may be required to purchase the beneficial interest in leases and leased vehicles if certain covenants made\\nby the servicer with respect to the leases or leased vehicles is breached. While VW Credit or the servicer may be obligated to reallocate or repurchase any beneficial interest in a lease and related leased vehicle if there is a breach of any of\\ntheir respective representations and warranties or covenants, as applicable, relating thereto which materially and adversely affects the interests of the issuing entity, there can be no assurance given that VW Credit or the servicer, as applicable,\\nwill financially be in a position to fund its repurchase obligation and you might experience delays or reductions in payments on your notes. Further, absent a breach of a representation and warranty (but only if such breach is not cured and\\nmaterially and adversely affects the interests of the issuing entity or the noteholders), or a breach of a servicing covenant specifically requiring reallocation, VW Credit will have no obligation to repurchase the beneficial interest in any lease\\nor related leased vehicle for which the related lessee was adversely affected by the outbreak of COVID-19 (including in the event the related lease is extended or modified after the cutoff date).\\n\\nReturns on your investments may be reduced by prepayments on the leases, events of default, optional redemption of the notes or reallocations of the leases and leased vehicles from the Transaction SUBI.\\n You may receive payments on your notes earlier than you expected for the reasons set forth below. You may not be able to invest the amounts\\npaid to you earlier than you expected at a rate of return that is equal to or greater than the rate of return on your notes.\\n•\\u2003\\u200aThe rate of return of principal is uncertain. The amount of distributions of principal of your\\nnotes and the time when you receive those distributions depend on the rate of payments and losses on the leases and the leased vehicles, which cannot be predicted with certainty. Prepayments, liquidations of defaulted leases or reallocations from\\nthe Transaction SUBI of leases and the related vehicles that do not meet certain eligibility criteria will shorten the life of the notes to an extent that cannot be predicted. Further, the leases allocated to the Transaction SUBI may be prepaid, in\\nfull or in part, voluntarily or as a result of defaults, theft of or damage to the related leased vehicles or for other reasons. For example, a lessee under certain circumstances may elect to terminate the lease prior to its maturity. Each of these\\npayments will have the effect of accelerating the payment of principal and shortening the average lives of the notes. The servicer cannot predict the actual prepayment rates for the leases, and VW Credit’s historical prepayment experience may\\nnot reflect circumstances similar to the current global outbreak of COVID-19. You will bear any reinvestment risk resulting from a faster or slower rate of payments of the leases and leased vehicles.\\n•\\u2003\\u200aYou may be unable to reinvest\\ndistributions in comparable investments. The occurrence of an optional redemption or an indenture default resulting in acceleration may require repayment of the notes prior to the expected principal payment date for one or more classes of notes.\\nAsset-backed securities, like the notes, usually produce a faster return of principal to investors as market\\n\\n \\xa0\\xa0\\u2003\\u2009\\u2009interest rates fall and produce a slower return of principal when\\nmarket interest rates rise. As a result, you are likely to receive more money to reinvest at a time when other investments generally are producing a lower yield than that on your notes, and are likely to receive less money to reinvest when other\\ninvestments generally are producing a higher yield than that on your notes. You will bear the risk that the timing and amount of distributions on your notes will prevent you from attaining your desired yield.\\n•\\u2003\\u200aAn early redemption of the\\nnotes from an optional redemption will shorten the life of your investment which may reduce your yield to maturity. If the Transaction SUBI is sold upon exercise of a “clean-up call” by the\\ndepositor, the issuing entity will redeem the notes and you will receive the remaining principal amount of your notes plus any other amounts due to noteholders, such as accrued interest through the related payment date. Because your notes will no\\nlonger be outstanding, you will not receive the additional interest payments or other distributions that you would have received had the notes remained outstanding. If you bought your notes at par or at a premium, your yield to maturity will be\\nlower than it would have been if the optional redemption had not been exercised. See “Description of the Transaction Documents—Redemption of the Notes” in this prospectus for a more detailed description of the depositor’s “clean-up call” option.\\n\\nYou must rely for repayment only upon the issuing entity’s assets which may not be sufficient to make full payments on your notes.\\nYour notes are secured solely by the assets of the issuing entity. Your notes will not represent an interest in or an obligation of VW Credit, the origination trust, the depositor or any of their respective affiliates. VW Credit and\\nthe servicer may have a limited obligation to repurchase the beneficial interest in some leases and related leased vehicles under some circumstances as described in this prospectus. Distributions on any class of notes will depend solely on the\\namount and timing of payments and other collections in respect of the leases and the credit enhancement described herein. We cannot assure you that these amounts, together with sales proceeds of the related leased vehicles, will be sufficient to\\nmake full and timely distributions on your notes. The notes and the leases will not be insured or guaranteed, in whole or in part, by the United States or any governmental entity or any other party.\\n\\n General Risk Factors\\n\\n\\n\\nRisk of loss or delay in payment may result from delays in the transfer of servicing due to the servicing fee structure.\\nBecause the servicing fee is structured as a percentage of the aggregate securitization value of the leases and leased vehicles, the amount of the servicing fee payable to the servicer may be considered insufficient by potential\\nreplacement servicers if servicing is required to be transferred at a time when much of the outstanding aggregate securitization value of the leases and leased vehicles has been repaid. Due to the reduction in servicing fee as described in the\\nforegoing, it may be difficult to find a replacement servicer. Consequently, the time it takes to effect the transfer of servicing to a replacement servicer under such circumstances may result in delays and/or reductions in the interest and\\nprincipal payments on your notes.\\n\\nYou may experience a loss or a delay in receiving payments on the notes if the\\nIf certain indenture defaults occur and the notes are accelerated, the indenture trustee may liquidate the assets of the issuing entity. If a\\n\\nassets of the issuing entity are liquidated.\\nliquidation occurs close to the date when any class otherwise would have been paid in full, repayment of that class might be delayed while liquidation of the assets is occurring. The issuing entity cannot predict the length of time\\nthat will be required for liquidation of the assets of the issuing entity to be completed. In addition, liquidation proceeds may not be sufficient to repay the notes in full. Even if liquidation proceeds are sufficient to repay the notes in full,\\nany liquidation that causes the outstanding principal amount of a class of notes to be paid before the related final scheduled payment date will involve the prepayment risks described under “Risk Factors—Returns on your investments may\\nbe reduced by prepayments on the leases, events of default, optional redemption of the notes or reallocations of the leases and leased vehicles from the Transaction SUBI” in this prospectus.\\n\\nYour share of possible losses may not be proportional.\\nPrincipal payments on the notes generally will be made to the holders of the notes sequentially so that no principal will be paid on any class of notes until each class of notes with an earlier final scheduled payment date has been\\npaid in full. As a result, a class of notes with a later maturity may absorb more losses than a class of notes with an earlier maturity.\\n\\nPrepayments, potential losses and a change in the order of priority of principal payments may result from an indenture default.\\n An indenture default may result in payments on your notes being accelerated. As a result:\\n•\\u2003\\u2002\\u200ayou may suffer losses\\non your notes if the assets of the issuing entity are insufficient to pay the amounts owed on your notes;\\n•\\u2003\\u2002\\u200apayments on your notes may be delayed until more senior classes of notes are repaid;\\nand •\\u2003\\u2002\\u200ayour notes may\\nbe repaid earlier than scheduled, which may require you to reinvest your principal at a lower rate of return.\\n\\nThe absence of a secondary market could limit your ability to resell your notes.\\nIf you want to sell your notes you must locate a purchaser that is willing to purchase those notes. The underwriters intend to make a secondary market for the notes. The underwriters will do so by offering to buy the notes from\\ninvestors that wish to sell. However, the underwriters will not be obligated to make offers to buy the notes and may stop making offers at any time. In addition, the prices offered, if any, may not reflect prices that other potential purchasers\\nwould be willing to pay, were they to be given the opportunity. There have been times in the past, including recently, where there have been very few buyers of asset-backed securities, and there may be these times again in the future. As a result,\\nyou may not be able to sell your notes when you want to do so or you may not be able to obtain the price that you wish to receive.\\n\\nLack of liquidity in the secondary market may adversely affect the ability to sell your notes.\\nRecent and, in some cases, continuing events in the global financial markets, including the current COVID-19 pandemic, the failure, acquisition or government seizure of several major financial\\ninstitutions, the establishment of government bailout programs for financial institutions, problems related to subprime mortgages and other financial assets, the de-valuation of various assets in secondary markets, the forced sale of asset-backed\\nand other securities as a result of the de-leveraging of structured investment vehicles, hedge funds, financial institutions and other entities, the lowering of rates on certain asset-backed securities and\\nBrexit and the related uncertainty surrounding the future of the UK’s relationship with the EU, have caused a significant reduction in liquidity in the secondary market\\n\\nfor asset-backed securities. This period of illiquidity may continue, and even worsen, and may adversely affect the value of your notes. As a result of the foregoing, you may not be able to sell your notes when you want to do so or\\nyou may not be able to obtain the price you wish to receive. See “Risk Factors—The absence of a secondary market for the notes could limit your ability to resell your notes” in this prospectus.\\n\\nThe ratings of the notes may be withdrawn or lowered, or the notes may receive an unsolicited rating, which may have an adverse effect on the liquidity or the market price of the notes.\\n Ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold the notes. Rather, ratings are an assessment by the applicable rating agency of the\\nlikelihood that any interest on a class of notes will be paid on a timely basis and that a class of notes will be paid in full by its final scheduled payment date. Ratings do not consider to what extent the notes will be subject to prepayment or\\nthat the principal of any class of notes will be paid prior to the final scheduled payment date for that class of notes, nor do the ratings consider the prices of the notes or their suitability to a particular investor. A rating agency may revise or\\nwithdraw the ratings at any time in its sole discretion, including as a result of a failure by the sponsor to comply with its obligation to post information provided to the Hired Agencies on a website that is accessible by a rating agency that is\\nnot a Hired Agency. The ratings of the notes may be lowered by a rating agency (including the Hired Agencies) following the initial issuance of the notes as a result of losses on the leases in excess of the levels contemplated by a rating agency at\\nthe time of its initial rating analysis. Neither the depositor nor the sponsor nor any of their respective affiliates will have any obligation to replace or supplement any credit support, or to take any other action to maintain any ratings of the\\nnotes. Accordingly, there is no assurance that the ratings assigned to any note on\\nthe closing date will not be lowered or withdrawn by any rating agency at any time thereafter. If any rating with respect to the notes is revised or withdrawn, the liquidity or the market value of your note may be adversely affected.\\nIt is possible that other rating agencies not hired by the sponsor may provide an\\nunsolicited rating that differs from (or is lower than) the rating provided by the Hired Agencies. As of the date of this prospectus, the depositor was not aware of the existence of any unsolicited rating provided (or to be provided at a future\\ntime) by any rating agency not hired to rate the transaction. However, there can be no assurance that an unsolicited rating will not be issued prior to or after the closing date, and none of the sponsor, the depositor nor any underwriter is\\nobligated to inform investors (or potential investors) in the notes if an unsolicited rating is issued after the date of this prospectus. Consequently, if you intend to purchase any notes, you should monitor whether an unsolicited rating of the\\nnotes has been issued by a non-hired rating agency and should consult with your financial and legal advisors regarding the impact of an unsolicited rating on a class of notes. If any non-hired rating agency provides an unsolicited rating that differs from (or is lower than) the rating provided by the Hired Agencies, the liquidity or the market value of your note may be adversely\\naffected.\\n\\nPotential rating agency conflict of interest and regulatory scrutiny.\\nThe Hired Agencies have been hired by the sponsor to provide their ratings on the notes. We note that a rating agency may have a conflict of interest where, as is the case with the ratings of the notes by the Hired Agencies, the\\nsponsor or the issuer of a security pays the fee charged by the rating agency for its rating services. Furthermore, rating agencies, including the Hired Agencies, have been and may continue to be under scrutiny by federal\\nand\\n\\nstate legislative and regulatory bodies for their roles in the financial crisis and such scrutiny and any actions such legislative and regulatory bodies may take as a result thereof may also have an adverse effect on the market\\nvalue of the notes and your ability to resell your notes.\\n\\nBecause the notes are in book-entry form, your rights can only be exercised indirectly.\\n Because the notes will initially be issued in book-entry form, you will be required to hold your interest in your notes through The\\nDepository Trust Company in the United States, or Clearstream Banking, société anonyme or Euroclear Bank S.A./NV as operator of the Euroclear System in Europe or Asia. Transfers of interests in the notes within The Depository Trust\\nCompany, Clearstream Banking, société anonyme or Euroclear Bank/S.A./NV as operator of the Euroclear System must be made in accordance with the usual rules and operating procedures of those systems. So long as the notes are in\\nbook-entry form, you will not be entitled to receive a definitive note representing your interest. The notes will remain in book-entry form except in the limited circumstances described under the caption “The Notes—Definitive\\nNotes” in this prospectus. Unless and until the notes cease to be held in book-entry form, the transaction parties will not recognize you as a holder of the notes.\\nAs a result, you will only be able to exercise the rights as a noteholder indirectly through The Depository Trust Company (if in the United States) and its\\nparticipating organizations, or Clearstream Banking, société anonyme and Euroclear Bank S.A./NV as operator of the Euroclear System (in Europe or Asia) and their participating organizations. Holding the notes in book-entry form could\\nalso limit your ability to pledge or transfer your notes to persons or entities that do not participate in The Depository Trust Company, Clearstream Banking, société anonyme or Euroclear Bank S.A./NV as operator of the Euroclear\\nSystem. In addition, having the notes in book-entry form may reduce their liquidity in the secondary market since certain potential investors may be unwilling to purchase securities for which they cannot obtain physical notes.\\nInterest on and principal of the notes will be paid by the issuing entity to The\\nDepository Trust Company as the record holder of notes while they are held in book-entry form. The Depository Trust Company will credit payments received from the issuing entity to the accounts of its participants which, in turn, will credit those\\namounts to noteholders either directly or indirectly through indirect participants. This process may delay your receipt of principal and interest payments from the issuing entity.\\n\\nThe notes may not be a suitable investment for you.\\nThe notes are not a suitable investment for you if you require a regular or predictable schedule of payments or payment on any specific date. The notes are complex investments that should be considered only by investors who, either\\nalone or with their financial, tax and legal advisors, have the expertise to analyze the prepayment, reinvestment, default and market risks, the tax consequences of an investment in the notes and the interaction of these factors.\\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Before deciding whether to invest in our common stock,\\nyou should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below. You should also consider the risks, uncertainties and assumptions discussed under the heading “Risk Factors” included in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and our subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, each of which is on file with the SEC and are incorporated herein by reference, and which may be amended, supplemented\\nor superseded from time to time by other reports we file with the SEC in the future. There may be other unknown or unpredictable economic, business, competitive, regulatory or other factors that could have material adverse effects on our future\\nresults. If any of these risks actually occurs, our business, business prospects, financial condition or results of operations could be seriously harmed. This could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline, resulting in a loss of all\\nor part of your investment. Please also read carefully the section above entitled “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.” Risks Related to This Offering and Our Common Stock The market price of our common stock may be highly volatile, and you may not be able to resell your shares at or\\nabove the offering price. Our stock price is likely to be volatile. Since our initial public offering\\nin June 2018, or our IPO, the trading price of our common stock has ranged from $9.76 to $53.70. The stock market in general, and the market for biopharmaceutical companies in particular, has experienced extreme volatility that has often been\\nunrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. As a result of this volatility, you may not be able to sell your common stock at or above the price at which you purchase shares. The market price for our common stock may be influenced\\nby many factors, including: \\n\\n•\\n adverse results or delays in preclinical studies or clinical trials;\\n\\n\\n•\\n reports of adverse events in other gene therapy products or clinical studies of such\\nproducts; \\n\\n•\\n an inability to obtain additional funding; \\n\\n•\\n failure by us to successfully develop and commercialize our product candidates;\\n\\n\\n•\\n failure by us to maintain our existing strategic collaborations or enter into new\\ncollaborations; \\n\\n•\\n failure by us or our licensors and strategic partners to prosecute, maintain or enforce our\\nintellectual property rights; \\n\\n•\\n changes in laws or regulations applicable to future products; \\n\\n•\\n an inability to obtain adequate product supply for our product candidates or the inability\\nto do so at acceptable prices; \\n\\n•\\n adverse regulatory decisions; \\n\\n•\\n the introduction of new products, services or technologies by our competitors;\\n\\n\\n•\\n failure by us to meet or exceed financial projections we may provide to the public;\\n\\n\\n•\\n failure by us to meet or exceed the financial projections of the investment community;\\n\\n\\n•\\n the perception of the pharmaceutical industry by the public, legislatures, regulators and\\nthe investment community; \\n\\n•\\n announcements of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or\\ncapital commitments by us, our strategic partner or our competitors; \\n\\n•\\n disputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents,\\nlitigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies; \\n\\n•\\n additions or departures of key scientific or management personnel;\\n\\n\\n•\\n significant lawsuits, including patent or stockholder litigation;\\n\\n\\n•\\n changes in the market valuations of similar companies; \\n\\n•\\n sales of our common stock by us or our stockholders in the future; and\\n\\n\\n•\\n the trading volume of our common stock. In addition, companies trading in the stock market in general, and The Nasdaq Global Select Market in particular, have\\nexperienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock,\\nregardless of our actual operating performance. We could be subject to securities class action\\nlitigation. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company\\nfollowing a decline in the market price of its securities. This risk is especially relevant for us because pharmaceutical companies have experienced significant stock price volatility in recent years. If we face such litigation, it could result in\\nsubstantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources, which could harm our business. An active trading market for our common stock may not be sustained. Although\\nour common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Global Select Market, an active trading market for our shares may never be sustained. If an active market for our common stock is not sustained, it may be difficult for you to sell shares you purchase in this\\noffering without depressing the market price for the shares, or at all. An inactive trading market may also\\nimpair our ability to raise capital to continue to fund operations by selling additional shares and may impair our ability to acquire other companies or technologies by using our shares as consideration. If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our\\nbusiness, our share price and trading volume could decline. The trading market for our common stock\\nwill likely depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. Although we have obtained research coverage from certain analysts, there\\ncan be no assurance that analysts will continue to cover us or provide favorable coverage. If one or more analysts downgrade our stock or change their opinion of our stock, our share price would likely decline. In addition, if one or more analysts\\ncease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline. Concentration of ownership of our common stock among our existing executive officers, directors and principal\\nstockholders may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions. Based on\\nshares outstanding as of September\\xa030, 2020, our executive officers, directors, five percent stockholders and their affiliates beneficially owned approximately 28% of our outstanding voting stock. As a result, if these stockholders were to act\\ntogether, they would be able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, as well as our management and affairs. For example, these stockholders, acting together, may be able to control elections of directors, amendments of our\\norganizational documents, or approval of any merger, sale of assets, or other major corporate transaction. This may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that you may believe are in your best interest\\nas one of our stockholders. Some of these persons or entities may have interests different than yours. For example, because \\nmany of these stockholders purchased their shares at prices substantially below the price at which you may purchase our shares and have held their shares for a longer period, they may be more\\ninterested in selling our company to an acquirer than other investors or they may want us to pursue strategies that deviate from the interests of other stockholders. We are an “emerging growth company,” and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging\\ngrowth companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors. We are an “emerging\\ngrowth company,” or EGC, as defined in the JOBS Act. We will remain an EGC until the earliest of: (i)\\xa0the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1.07\\xa0billion or more; (ii)\\xa0the last day of the\\nfiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the completion of our IPO; (iii)\\xa0the date on which we have issued more than $1.0\\xa0billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or (iv)\\xa0the date on which we\\nare deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC, which means the first day of the year following the first year in which the market value of our common stock that is held by\\nnon-affiliates exceeds $700\\xa0million as of June 30. For so long as we remain an EGC, we are permitted and intend to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to other\\npublic companies that are not emerging growth companies. These exemptions include: \\n\\n•\\n not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section\\xa0404\\nof the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or Section\\xa0404; \\n\\n•\\n not being required to comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company\\nAccounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements; \\n\\n•\\n being permitted to provide only two years of audited financial statements, in addition to\\nany required unaudited interim financial statements, with correspondingly reduced “Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” disclosure; \\n\\n•\\n reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation; and\\n\\n\\n•\\n an exemption from the requirement to seek nonbinding advisory votes on executive\\ncompensation or golden parachute arrangements. We may choose to take advantage of some,\\nbut not all, of the available exemptions. We have taken advantage of reduced reporting burdens. In particular, we have not included all of the executive compensation information that would be required if we were not an EGC. We cannot predict whether\\ninvestors will find our common stock less attractive if we rely on certain or all of these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock\\nprice may be reduced or more volatile. In addition, the JOBS Act provides that an EGC may take advantage of\\nan extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This allows an EGC to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to avail\\nourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will not be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. Even after we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, we may still qualify as a “smaller reporting\\ncompany” if the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates is below $250\\xa0million (or $700\\xa0million if our annual revenue is less than $100 million) as of June\\xa030 in any given\\nyear, which would allow us to take advantage of many of the same exemptions from disclosure requirements. If you purchase our common stock in this offering, you will incur\\nimmediate and substantial dilution in the book value of your shares. Investors purchasing shares of\\ncommon stock in this offering will pay a price per share that substantially exceeds the as adjusted book value per share of our tangible assets after subtracting our liabilities. As a result, investors purchasing shares of common stock in this\\noffering will incur immediate dilution of $8.29 per share, based on the public offering price of $15.00 per share, and our as adjusted net tangible book value as of September\\xa030, 2020. Further, based on these assumptions, investors purchasing\\nshares of common stock in this offering will contribute approximately 14.3% of the total amount invested by stockholders since our inception, but will own only approximately 12.1% of the shares of common stock outstanding. For information on how the\\nforegoing amounts were calculated, see “Dilution.” You may experience future dilution as a\\nresult of future equity offerings. In order to raise additional capital, we may in the future offer\\nadditional shares of our common stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock at prices that may not be the same as the price per share in this offering. We may sell shares or other securities in any other offering\\nat a price per share that is less than the price per share paid by investors in this offering, and investors purchasing shares or other securities in the future could have rights superior to those of existing stockholders. The price per share at\\nwhich we sell additional shares of our common stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into common stock, in future transactions may be higher or lower than the price per share paid by investors in this offering. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to\\nfall. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the\\nperception that these sales might occur could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We are unable to predict the effect that such sales may have\\non the prevailing market price of our common stock. In addition, the sale of substantial amounts of our common stock could adversely impact its price. As of September\\xa030, 2020, we had outstanding 36,449,153 shares of our common stock, options\\nto purchase 5,658,890 shares of our common stock (of which 1,754,340 were exercisable as of that date) and 1,342 shares of common stock issuable upon the vesting of restricted stock units (none of which were vested as of that date). The sale or the\\navailability for sale of a large number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause the price of our common stock to decline. While our directors and officers and certain stockholders affiliated with one of our directors have\\nentered into lock-up agreements in connection with this offering, these lock-up agreements include, among other exceptions, an exception for sales or other dispositions of shares of our common stock pursuant to 10b5-1 plans in place on the date of\\nthis prospectus, and as a result, a significant number of shares of our common stock currently held by such parties could be sold in the public market during the applicable restricted period under such agreements. See “Underwriting”.\\nWe have broad discretion in the use of the net proceeds from this offering and may not use them\\neffectively. Our management will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds from\\nthis offering, including for any of the purposes described in the section entitled “Use of Proceeds,” and you will not have the opportunity as part of your investment decision to assess whether the net proceeds are being used\\nappropriately. Because of the number and variability of factors that will determine our use of the net proceeds from this offering, their ultimate use may vary substantially from their currently intended use. The failure by our management to apply\\nthese funds effectively could harm our business. Pending their use, we may invest the net proceeds from this offering in short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing securities. These investments may not yield a favorable return to our\\nstockholders. We do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock so any returns\\nwill be limited to the value of our stock. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our\\ncommon stock. We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Any return to\\nstockholders will therefore be limited to the appreciation of their stock. For example, our prior loan facility with Silicon Valley Bank restricted our ability to pay any dividends or making any distributions on account of our capital stock, and we\\nmay enter into agreements in the future with similar restrictions. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future. Changes in tax law could adversely affect our business and financial condition. The rules dealing with U.S. federal, state, and local income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in\\nthe legislative process and by the Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Treasury Department. Changes to tax laws (which changes may have retroactive application) could adversely affect us or holders of our common stock. In recent years, many such\\nchanges have been made and changes are likely to continue to occur in the future. Future changes in tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition orresults of operations. We urge investors to\\nconsult with their legal and tax advisers regarding the implications of potential changes in tax laws on an investment in our common stock. Our bylaws contain exclusive forum provisions, which may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a\\njudicial forum it finds favorable and may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. Our\\namended and restated bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any state law claim for (1)\\xa0any derivative action or\\nproceeding brought on our behalf; (2)\\xa0any action asserting a claim of breach of or based on a fiduciary duty owed by any of our current or former directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders; (3)\\xa0any action asserting a\\nclaim against us or any of our current or former directors, officers, employees or stockholders arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and\\nrestated bylaws; or (4)\\xa0any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, or the Delaware Forum Provision. The Delaware Forum Provision will not apply to any causes of action arising under the Securities Act or the\\nExchange Act. Our amended and restated bylaws further provide that, unless we consent in writing to an alternative forum, the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint\\nasserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act, or the Federal Forum Provision, as our principal executive offices are located in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In addition, our amended and restated bylaws provide that any person or entity\\npurchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock is deemed to have notice of and consented to the foregoing Delaware Forum Provision and the Federal Forum Provision; provided, however, that stockholders cannot and will\\nnot be deemed to have waived our compliance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. We recognize that the Delaware Forum Provision and the Federal Forum Provision may impose additional litigation costs on stockholders who assert the provision is not enforceable and may impose more general additional litigation\\ncosts in pursuing any such claims, particularly if the stockholders do not reside in or near the State of Delaware or the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Additionally, these forum selection clauses in our amended and restated bylaws may limit our\\nstockholders’ ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that they find favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees even\\nthough an action, if successful, might benefit our stockholders. While the Delaware Supreme Court ruled in March 2020 that federal forum selection provisions purporting to require claims under the Securities Act be brought in federal court are\\n“facially valid” under Delaware law, there is uncertainty as to whether other courts will enforce our Federal Forum Provision. The \\nFederal Forum Provision may also impose additional litigation costs on stockholders who assert the provision is unenforceable, and if the Federal Forum Provision is found to be unenforceable, we\\nmay incur additional costs with resolving such matters. The Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts may also reach different judgments or results than would other courts,\\nincluding courts where a stockholder considering an action may be located or would otherwise choose to bring the action, and such judgments may be more or less favorable to us than our stockholders. An investment in our securities is subject to risks inherent\\nto our business. The material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect us are described below. Before making an\\ninvestment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information\\nincluded or incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus. The risks and uncertainties\\ndescribed below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are not aware of or focused on or that\\nwe currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. We also update risk factors from time to time in our periodic\\nreports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K which will be incorporated by reference to this prospectus supplement and the accompanying\\nprospectus. If any of the following risks actually occur, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially\\nand adversely affected. If this were to happen, the value of our common stock could decline significantly, and you could lose all\\nor part of your investment.Risks Relating\\nto this Offering and Our SecuritiesWe may allocate net proceeds\\nfrom this offering in ways which differ from our estimates based on our current plans and assumptions discussed in the section\\nentitled “Use of Proceeds” and with which you may not agree.The allocation of net proceeds of the\\noffering set forth in the “Use of Proceeds” section below represents our estimates based upon our current plans and\\nassumptions regarding industry and general economic conditions, our future revenues and expenditures. The amounts and timing of\\nour actual expenditures will depend on numerous factors, including market conditions, cash generated by our operations, business\\ndevelopments and related rate of growth. We may find it necessary or advisable to use portions of the proceeds from this offering\\nfor other purposes. Circumstances that may give rise to a change in the use of proceeds and the alternate purposes for which the\\nproceeds may be used are discussed in the section entitled “Use of Proceeds” below. You may not have an opportunity\\nto evaluate the economic, financial or other information on which we base our decisions on how to use our proceeds. As a result,\\nyou and other stockholders may not agree with our decisions. See “Use of Proceeds” below for additional information.Investors will suffer immediate and substantial dilution\\nas a result of this offering.Investors of shares of our common stock offered by this prospectus\\nsupplement and the accompanying prospectus will suffer immediate and substantial dilution of their investment. Based on the public\\noffering price of $30.00 per share and our net tangible book value as of September 30, 2020, if you purchase shares of common stock\\nin this offering, you will suffer immediate and substantial dilution of $26.94 per share, with respect to the net tangible book\\nvalue of the common stock. See “Dilution” in this prospectus supplement for a more detailed discussion of the dilution\\nthat investors will incur in this offering.Future financings could adversely affect common stock\\nownership interest and rights in comparison with those of other security holders.Our board of directors has the power to issue additional shares\\nof common or preferred stock without stockholder approval. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity or convertible\\ndebt securities, the percentage of ownership of our existing stockholders will be reduced, and these newly issued securities may\\nhave rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders. If we issue additional shares of common stock\\nor securities convertible into common stock, such issuance will reduce the proportionate ownership and voting power of each other\\nstockholder. In addition, such stock issuances might result in a reduction of the book value of our common stock.Future sales by our stockholders\\nmay adversely affect our stock price and our ability to raise funds in new stock offerings.Sales of our common stock by our stockholders\\nand warrant, option or preferred stock holders following this offering could lower the market price of our common stock. Sales\\nmay also make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price\\nthat our management deems acceptable or at all.S-4Sales of a significant number of shares of common stock\\nin the public markets, or the perception that such sales could occur, could depress the market price of our shares of common stock.Sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock in the\\npublic markets could depress the market price of our shares of common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the\\nsale of additional equity securities. We cannot predict the effect that future sales of our shares of common stock would have on\\nthe market price of our shares of common stock.The market price of our common stock may be adversely\\naffected by market conditions affecting the stock markets in general, including price and trading fluctuations on Nasdaq.Market conditions may result in volatility in the level of,\\nand fluctuations in, market prices of stocks generally and, in turn, our common stock and sales of substantial amounts of our common\\nstock in the market, in each case being unrelated or disproportionate to changes in our operating performance. A weak global economy\\nor other circumstances, such as changes in tariffs and trade, could also contribute to extreme volatility of the markets, which\\nmay have an effect on the market price of our common stock.We are not currently paying dividends and will likely\\nnot pay dividends for the foreseeable future.We have never paid or declared any cash dividends on our common\\nstock. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings to fund the development and expansion of our business,\\nand we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination to pay cash dividends will\\nbe at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements,\\ncontractual restrictions and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant.Our business could be negatively impacted by the recent\\nCoronavirus (“COVID-19”) outbreak or other similar outbreaks.The recent outbreak of COVID-19, and any other outbreaks of\\ncontagious diseases or other adverse public health developments in countries where we operate or our customers are located, could\\nhave a negative effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. These effects could include disruptions\\nor restrictions on our employees’ ability to work effectively, as well as temporary closures of our facilities or the facilities\\nof our customers or suppliers. This could affect our performance on our contracts. Resulting cost increases may not be fully recoverable\\nor adequately covered by insurance, which could impact our profitability. In addition, the outbreak of COVID-19 has resulted in\\na widespread health crisis that is adversely affecting the economies and financial markets of many countries, which could result\\nin an economic downturn that may negatively affect demand for our products. The extent to which COVID-19 could impact our business,\\nresults of operations and financial condition is highly uncertain and will depend on future developments. Such developments may\\ninclude the geographic spread and duration of the virus, the severity of the disease and the actions that may be taken by various\\ngovernmental authorities and other third parties in response to the outbreak.S-5CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING\\nSTATEMENTSThis prospectus supplement, the accompanying prospectus and\\nthe documents we have filed with the SEC that are incorporated by reference into this prospectus supplement and the accompanying\\nprospectus contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the\\n“Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).\\nForward-looking statements reflect our current view about future plans, intentions or expectations. These forward-looking statements\\nmay be included herein or incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement or the accompanying prospectus and include, in\\nparticular, statements about our plans, strategies and prospects and may be identified by terminology such as “may”,\\n“will”, “should”, “expect”, “scheduled”, “plan”, “intend”,\\n“anticipate”, “believe”, “estimate”, “aim”, “potential”, or “continue”\\nor the negative of those terms or other comparable terminology. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties\\nand assumptions about us. Although we believe that our plans, intentions and expectations are reasonable, we may not achieve our\\nplans, intentions or expectations.Important factors that could cause actual results to differ\\nmaterially from the forward-looking statements we make in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus are set forth\\nin this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus under the caption “Risk Factors”, and in the reports\\nwe have filed or will file with the SEC and which are incorporated by reference herein and therein, including statements under\\nthe caption “Risk Factors” and “Forward-Looking Statements” in such reports. All forward-looking statements\\nattributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements in this\\nprospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus under the caption “Risk Factors”, and in the reports we have\\nfiled or will file with the SEC and which are incorporated by reference herein and therein, including statements under the caption\\n“Risk Factors” and “Forward-Looking Statements” in such reports, in which we have disclosed the material\\nrisks related to our business. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, and the cautionary statements\\nidentify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted in any forward-looking statements.\\nWe undertake no obligation to update any of the forward-looking statements after the date of this prospectus supplement to conform\\nthose statements to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by applicable law. You should read this\\nprospectus supplement, the accompanying prospectus and the documents incorporated by reference herein and therein completely and\\nwith the understanding that our actual future results, levels of activity, performance and achievements may be materially different\\nfrom what we expect. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements.S-6USE OF PROCEEDSWe estimate that our net proceeds from this offering will be\\napproximately $6.975 million after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions but prior to estimated offering expenses\\npayable by us. We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for working capital and other general corporate purposes.The allocation of the net proceeds of the offering set forth\\nabove represents our estimates based upon our current plans and assumptions regarding industry and general economic conditions,\\nour future revenues and expenditures.The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend\\nupon numerous factors, including market conditions, cash generated by our operations, business developments and related rate of\\ngrowth. We may find it necessary or advisable to use portions of the proceeds from this offering for other purposes.Circumstances that may give rise to a change in the use of proceeds\\nand the alternate purposes for which the proceeds may be used include:\\n\\n•\\nthe existence of other opportunities or the need to take advantage of changes in timing of our existing activities;\\n\\n\\n•\\nthe need or desire on our part to accelerate, increase or eliminate existing initiatives due to, among other things, changing market conditions and competitive developments; and/or\\n\\n\\n•\\nif strategic opportunities of which we are not currently aware present themselves (including acquisitions, joint ventures, licensing and other similar transactions).\\nFrom time to time, we evaluate these and other factors and we\\nanticipate continuing to make such evaluations to determine if the existing allocation of resources, including the proceeds of\\nthis offering, is being optimized. Pending such uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds of this offering in direct and guaranteed\\nobligations of the United States, interest-bearing, investment-grade instruments or certificates of deposit.S-7DILUTIONIf you invest in our common stock, you will experience dilution\\nto the extent of the difference between the price per share you pay in this offering and the net tangible book value per share\\nof our common stock immediately after this offering.Our net tangible book value as of September 30, 2020, was approximately\\n$15 million, or $2.16\\xa0per share of common stock. Net tangible book value per share is equal to our total tangible assets minus\\ntotal liabilities, all divided by the number of shares of common stock outstanding as of September 30, 2020. After giving effect\\nto the sale of shares of common stock by us in this offering at a price of $30.00 per share, and after deducting the\\xa0underwriting\\ndiscount and commissions, and estimated offering expenses payable by us, our as adjusted net tangible book value would have been\\napproximately $22 million, or approximately $3.06 per share of common stock, as of September 30, 2020. This represents an immediate\\nincrease in net tangible book value of approximately $0.90 per share to existing stockholders and an immediate dilution of approximately\\n$26.94 per share to new investors.

The underwriter may close out any short position by either exercising its option to purchase\\nadditional shares or purchasing shares in the open market.In addition, the underwriter may stabilize or maintain the price\\nof our common stock by bidding for or purchasing shares in the open market and may impose penalty bids. If penalty bids are imposed,\\nselling concessions allowed to broker-dealers participating in this offering are reclaimed if shares previously distributed in\\nthis offering are repurchased, whether in connection with stabilization transactions or otherwise. The effect of these transactions\\nmay be to stabilize or maintain the market price of our common stock at a level above that which might otherwise prevail in the\\nopen market. The imposition of a penalty bid may also affect the price of our common stock to the extent that it discourages resales\\nof our common stock. The magnitude or effect of any stabilization or other transactions is uncertain.

Rule\\xa0103 of Regulation\\xa0M promulgated by the Securities and\\nExchange Commission limits the amount of net purchases that each passive market maker may make and the displayed size of each bid.\\nPassive market making may stabilize the market price of our common stock at a level above that which might otherwise prevail in\\nthe open market and, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time.Neither we nor the underwriter make any representation or prediction\\nas to the direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of our common stock.\\nIn addition, neither we nor the underwriter make any representation that the underwriter will engage in these transactions or that\\nany transaction, if commenced, will not be discontinued without notice.AffiliationsThe underwriter and its affiliates is a full service financial\\ninstitution engaged in various activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory,\\ninvestment management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities.

We believe that there is a clear need for a rapidly\\ndeployable and highly scalable EV charging infrastructure, and that our EV ARC™ and Solar Tree™ products fulfill that\\nrequirement. We are agnostic as to the EV charging service equipment (“EVSE”) as we do not sell EV charging, rather\\nwe sell products which enable it. Our EV ARC™ and Solar Tree™ products replace the infrastructure required to support\\nEV chargers, not the chargers themselves.We believe our chief\\ndifferentiators are:\\n\\n•\\n\\nour ability to invent, design,\\nengineer, and manufacture solar powered products which dramatically reduce the cost, time and complexity of the installation and\\noperation of EV charging infrastructure and outdoor media platforms when compared to traditional, utility grid tied alternatives;\\n\\n•\\n\\nour products’ capability\\nto operate during grid outages and to provide a source of emergency power rather than becoming inoperable during times of emergency\\nor other grid interruptions; and\\n\\n•\\n\\nour ability to create new and\\npatentable inventions which are marketable and a complex integration of our own proprietary technology and parts, and other commonly\\navailable engineered components, creating a further barrier to entry for our competition.\\nEnvision\\nwas formed in June 2006 as a limited liability company.

Before deciding whether to invest in our common stock, you should\\ncarefully consider the risks described below and the risks described under “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December\\xa031, 2019, as amended on Form\\xa010-K/A, as well as the other risks and uncertainties described in the other documents incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus and the information contained\\nin our other filings with the SEC, which are incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus in their entirety, and in any free writing prospectus that we have authorized for use in connection with this\\noffering. If any of these risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow could be seriously harmed. This could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline, resulting in a loss of all or part\\nof your investment. Risks Related to Our IndebtednessIf we are unable to raise additional capital when required or on acceptable terms, the repayment of our existing indebtedness could be accelerated, which\\nraises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Based on our current projections, following the\\ncompletion of this offering, assuming we sell $50,000,000 of shares of our common stock pursuant to this prospectus supplement, we anticipate that we will need to raise additional capital in order to maintain compliance with the minimum unrestricted\\ncash balance requirement of our financing agreement with Sixth Street Partners, or the Financing Agreement. In order to address our projected capital needs, we are pursuing various financing and other alternatives including the sale of a controlling\\ninterest in vitaCare Prescription Services for which we commenced a sale process and received initial indications of interest. However, we cannot guarantee that future financing sufficient to maintain or exceed the minimum unrestricted cash balance\\nunder the Financing Agreement will be available in sufficient amounts, in a timely fashion, or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we are unable to maintain the minimum unrestricted cash balance or otherwise comply with any other covenant of\\nthe Financing Agreement (including the total minimum net revenue requirements), all or a portion of our obligations under the Financing Agreement may be declared immediately due and payable, which would have a material adverse effect on our\\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition. Along with considering additional financings, we have reviewed numerous\\npotential scenarios in connection with the impact of\\xa0COVID-19\\xa0on our business including the impact of the recent steps we have taken to reduce our operating expenses in response. Based on our\\nanalysis, we believe that our existing cash reserves along with potential proceeds from the sale of certain\\xa0non-core\\xa0assets of the Company and proceeds from potential future financings, if available\\nto us, would be sufficient to meet our cash needs arising in the ordinary course of business for the next twelve months from the date of this prospectus supplement. However, if we are unsuccessful with future financings and if the successful\\ncommercialization of IMVEXXY, BIJUVA, or ANNOVERA is delayed, or the continued impact of the\\xa0COVID-19\\xa0pandemic on our business is worse than we anticipate, our existing cash reserves would be\\ninsufficient to maintain compliance with the Financing Agreement covenants or satisfy our liquidity requirements until we are able to successfully commercialize IMVEXXY, BIJUVA, and ANNOVERA. The presence of these projected factors in conjunction\\nwith the uncertainty of the capital markets raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for the next twelve months from the date of this prospectus supplement. Additional Risks Related to this Offering and our Common Stock Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock, or the perception that such sales might occur, could adversely affect the trading price of\\nour common stock. As of September\\xa030, 2020, we had 272,812,271 shares of our common stock outstanding. Also, we had, as of\\nSeptember\\xa030, 2020, up to 41,303,594 shares of our common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding \\noptions, restricted stock units, performance stock units and warrants. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market following this offering could cause the\\nmarket price of our common stock to decline. Although there can be no assurance that any of the $50,000,000 worth of shares being offered under this prospectus supplement will be sold or the price at which any such shares might be sold, assuming\\nthat an aggregate of 37,313,433 shares of our common stock are sold during the term of the sales agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald, in each case, for example, at a price of $1.34 per share, the last reported sale price of our common stock on the\\nNasdaq Global Select Market on November\\xa025, 2020, upon completion of this offering, based on our shares outstanding as of September\\xa030, 2020, including the 26,953,125 shares of common stock we issued in connection with our November 2020\\nunderwritten public offering of common stock, we will have outstanding an aggregate of 337,078,829 shares of common stock, assuming no exercise or settlement, as the case may be, of our outstanding stock options, restricted stock units, performance\\nstock units or warrants. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock, or the perception that such sales might occur, could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. Further, sales of shares underlying stock options,\\nrestricted stock units, performance stock units and warrants, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock. You may experience immediate and substantial dilution in the book value per share of the common stock you purchase and may experience further dilution\\nin the future as a result of equity offerings and other issuances of our common stock or other securities. The offering price per\\nshare in this offering may exceed the net tangible book value per share of our common stock outstanding prior to this offering. Assuming that an aggregate of 37,313,433 shares of our common stock are sold in this offering at a price of $1.34 per\\nshare, the last reported sale price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on November 25, 2020, for aggregate gross proceeds of $50,000,000, and after deducting commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us, you will\\nexperience immediate dilution of $1.70 per share, representing the difference between our as adjusted net tangible book value per share as of September\\xa030, 2020 after giving effect to this offering and the assumed offering price. The exercise\\nof outstanding stock options and warrants and the settlement of outstanding restricted stock units and performance stock units will result in further dilution of your investment. See the section entitled “Dilution” below for a more\\ndetailed illustration of the dilution you would incur if you participate in this offering. To raise additional capital, we may in the\\nfuture offer additional shares of our common stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock at prices that may not be the same as the price per share in this offering. We cannot assure you that we will be able to\\nsell shares or other securities in any other offering at a price per share that is equal to or greater than the price per share paid by investors in this offering, and investors purchasing shares or other securities in the future could have rights\\nsuperior to existing stockholders. As of September\\xa030, 2020, there were outstanding options representing the right to purchase a\\ntotal of 23,893,180 shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $4.80 per share, 6,029,957 shares of common stock underlying outstanding restricted stock units, up to 4,845,770 shares of common stock underlying outstanding\\nperformance stock units, outstanding warrants representing the right to purchase a total of 6,534,687 shares of our common stock at a weighted-average exercise price of $1.83 per share, 3,465,514 shares of our common stock reserved for future\\nissuance under our\\xa0non-qualified\\xa0stock option plans and 5,400,000 shares of common stock reserved for future issuance under our employee stock purchase plan. You will incur dilution upon exercise of\\nany outstanding stock options or warrants or upon the issuance of shares of common stock under our stock incentive programs. In addition,\\nthe sale of shares in this offering and any future sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales may occur, could adversely affect the price of our common stock. We cannot predict\\nthe effect, if any, that market sales of those shares of common stock or the availability of those shares of common stock for sale will have on the market price of our common stock. We have broad discretion to determine how to use the proceeds raised in this offering, and we may not\\nuse the proceeds effectively. Our management will have broad discretion over the use of proceeds from this offering, and we could\\nspend the proceeds from this offering in ways with which you may not agree or that do not yield a favorable return. We intend to use a majority of the net proceeds from this offering for commercialization of IMVEXXY, BIJUVA and ANNOVERA, including\\nto maximize ANNOVERA’s consumer-focused commercialization strategy. We additionally intend to use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering for working capital and general corporate purposes. If we do not invest or apply the proceeds of\\nthis offering in ways that improve our operating results, we may fail to achieve expected financial results, which could cause our stock price to decline. It is not possible to predict the aggregate proceeds resulting from sales made under the sales agreement. Subject to certain limitations in the sales agreement and compliance with applicable law, we have the discretion to deliver a placement notice\\nto Cantor Fitzgerald at any time throughout the term of the sales agreement. The number of shares that are sold through Cantor Fitzgerald after delivering a placement notice will fluctuate based on a number of factors, including the market price of\\nour common stock during the sales period, any limits we may set with Cantor Fitzgerald in any applicable placement notice and the demand for our common stock. Because this offering can be terminated at any time and the price per share of each share\\nsold pursuant to the sales agreement will fluctuate over time, it is not currently possible to predict the aggregate proceeds to be raised in connection with sales under the sales agreement. Sales of common stock offered hereby will be in “at the market offerings,” and investors who buy shares at different times will likely pay\\ndifferent prices. Investors who purchase shares in this offering at different times will likely pay different prices, and\\naccordingly may experience different levels of dilution and different outcomes in their investment results. We will have discretion, subject to market demand, to vary the timing, prices and number of shares sold in this offering. In addition,\\nsubject to the final determination by our board of directors or any restrictions we may place in any applicable placement notice delivered to Cantor Fitzgerald, there is no minimum or maximum sales price for shares to be sold in this offering.\\nInvestors may experience a decline in the value of the shares they purchase in this offering as a result of sales made at prices lower than the prices they paid.

Forward-looking statements may include, but\\nare not limited to, statements relating to our objectives, plans and strategies as well as statements, other than historical facts, that address activities, events or developments that we intend, expect, project, believe or anticipate will or may\\noccur in the future. These statements are often characterized by terminology such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “could,” “intends,”\\n“target,” “projects,” “contemplates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “predicts,” “potential,” or “continue” or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions.

Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control.\\nYou should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which reflect our view only as of the date of this prospectus supplement, and we undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements in the future, except as\\nrequired by applicable law. A number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the\\nforward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those factors described under the caption “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form\\xa010-K\\xa0for the fiscal year ended\\nDecember\\xa031, 2019, as amended on Form\\xa010-K/A, which is incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus, and under similar headings in our subsequently filed\\nquarterly reports on Form\\xa010-Q,\\xa0as well as the other risks and uncertainties described herein and in the other documents incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement. Some of the key\\nfactors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations include the following: \\n\\n•\\n the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic; \\n\\n•\\n whether we will be able to comply with the covenants and conditions under our term loan facility;\\n\\n\\n•\\n whether we will be able to successfully divest our vitaCare business and the proceeds that may be generated by\\nsuch divestiture; \\n\\n•\\n our ability to maintain or increase sales of our products; \\n\\n•\\n our ability to develop and commercialize IMVEXXY, ANNOVERA, BIJUVA and our hormone therapy drug candidates and\\nobtain additional financing necessary therefor; \\n\\n•\\n the potential of adverse side effects or other safety risks that could adversely affect the commercialization of\\nour current or future approved products or preclude the approval of our future drug candidates; \\n\\n•\\n the length, cost and uncertain results of future clinical trials; \\n\\n•\\n our reliance on third parties to conduct our clinical trials, research and development and manufacturing;\\n\\n\\n•\\n our ability to protect our intellectual property, including with respect to the Paragraph IV notice letters we\\nreceived regarding IMVEXXY and BIJUVA;\\n\\n•\\n the ability of our licensees to commercialize and distribute our products; \\n\\n•\\n the effects of laws, regulations and enforcement; \\n\\n•\\n the competitive nature of the industries in which we conduct our business; \\n\\n•\\n the availability of reimbursement from government authorities and health insurance companies for our products;\\n\\n\\n•\\n the impact of product liability lawsuits; \\n\\n•\\n the influence of extensive and costly government regulation; \\n\\n•\\n whether the FDA will approve the efficacy supplement for the lower dose of BIJUVA; \\n\\n•\\n the ability of our marketing contractors to market ANNOVERA; \\n\\n•\\n the volatility of the trading price of our common stock; and \\n\\n•\\n the concentration of power in our stock ownership. USE OF PROCEEDS The amount of proceeds from this offering will depend upon the number of shares of our common stock sold and the market price at which they\\nare sold. There can be no assurance that we will be able to sell any shares under or fully utilize the sales agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald as a source of financing. We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to for commercialization of IMVEXXY, BIJUVA and ANNOVERA, including to maximize\\nANNOVERA’s consumer-focused commercialization strategy, and for working capital and general corporate purposes. As of the date of\\nthis prospectus supplement, we cannot specify with certainty all of the particular uses of the proceeds from this offering. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend on numerous factors, including the progress of\\ncommercialization activities, the timing of our revenue and the amount of cash used by our operations. Accordingly, we will retain broad discretion over the use of such proceeds. DILUTION Purchasers of common stock in this offering will experience immediate dilution to the extent of the difference between the purchase price per\\nshare of common stock, and the net tangible book value per share of common stock immediately after this offering. Our net tangible book\\nvalue as of September\\xa030, 2020 was approximately $(158.5)\\xa0million, or $(0.58) per share. Net tangible book value per share is determined by dividing our total tangible assets, less total liabilities, by the number of shares of our common\\nstock outstanding as of September\\xa030, 2020. Dilution in net tangible book value per share represents the difference between the amount per share paid by purchasers of shares of common stock in this offering and the net tangible book value per\\nshare of our common stock immediately after this offering. After giving effect to the sale of shares of common stock offered by the\\nprospectus supplement at an assumed purchase price of $1.34 per share of common stock (the last reported sale price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on November 25, 2020), and after deducting the commissions and estimated\\naggregate offering expenses payable by us, our net tangible book value as of September\\xa030, 2020 would have been approximately $(111.2) million, or $(0.36) per share of common stock. This represents an immediate increase in net tangible book\\nvalue of $0.22 per share to our existing stockholders and an immediate dilution of $1.70 per share of common stock issued to the new investors purchasing securities in this offering. The following table illustrates this per share dilution: \\n\\n Assumed purchase price per share of common stock\\n$\\n1.34\\n\\n\\n Net tangible book deficit per share as of September\\xa030, 2020\\n$\\n(0.58\\n)\\xa0\\n\\n\\n Increase per share attributable to new investors\\n$\\n0.22\\n\\n\\n As adjusted net tangible book value per share after this offering\\n$\\n(0.36\\n)\\xa0\\n\\n Dilution per share to new investors\\n$\\n1.70\\n\\nThe table above assumes for illustrative purposes that an aggregate of 37,313,433 shares of our common stock\\nare sold at a price of $1.34 per share, the last reported sale price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on November 25, 2020, for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $50,000,000. The shares sold in this offering, if any,\\nwill be sold from time to time at various prices. An increase of $1.00 per share in the price at which the shares are sold from the assumed offering price of $1.34 per share shown in the table above, assuming all of our common stock in the aggregate\\namount of $50,000,000 is sold at that price, would result in an as adjusted net tangible book value per share after this offering of approximately $(0.38) per share and would increase the dilution in net tangible book value per share to new\\ninvestors to $2.72 per share, after deducting commissions and estimated aggregate offering expenses payable by us. A decrease of $1.00 per share in the price at which the shares are sold from the assumed offering price of $1.34 per share shown in\\nthe table above, assuming all of our common stock in the aggregate amount of $50,000,000 is sold at that price, would result in an as adjusted net tangible book value per share after this offering of approximately $(0.26) per share and would\\ndecrease the dilution in net tangible book value per share to new investors to $0.60 per share, after deducting commissions and estimated aggregate offering expenses payable by us. The information discussed above is illustrative only and may differ based on the actual offering price and the actual number of shares\\noffered. The number of shares of common stock to be outstanding immediately after this offering is based on 272,812,271 shares\\noutstanding on September\\xa030, 2020 and excludes the following as of that date: \\n\\n•\\n outstanding options representing the right to purchase a total of 23,893,180 shares of common stock at a weighted\\naverage exercise price of $4.80 per share; \\n\\n•\\n 6,029,957 shares of common stock underlying outstanding restricted stock units; \\n\\n•\\n up to 4,845,770 shares of common stock underlying outstanding performance stock units; \\n\\n•\\n outstanding warrants representing the right to purchase a total of 6,534,687 shares of common stock at a\\nweighted-average exercise price of $1.83 per share; \\n\\n•\\n 3,465,514 shares of common stock reserved for future issuance under\\nour\\xa0non-qualified\\xa0stock option plans; \\n\\n•\\n 5,400,000 shares of common stock reserved for future issuance under our employee stock purchase plan; and\\n\\n\\n•\\n 26,953,125 shares of common stock issued in connection with our November 2020 underwritten public offering of\\ncommon stock. To the extent that outstanding options or warrants are exercised or we issue shares of common stock under\\nour stock incentive plans, investors purchasing our common stock in this offering will experience further dilution. In addition, we may choose to raise additional capital due to market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we\\nhave sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. To the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of these securities could result in further dilution to our\\nstockholders. CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF NEVADA LAW AND OUR CHARTER AND BYLAWS The following paragraphs summarize certain provisions of Nevada law and our amended and restated articles of incorporation, as amended, and\\nbylaws. The summary does not purport to be complete and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to Nevada law and to our amended and restated articles of incorporation, as amended, and bylaws, as amended, copies of which are on file\\nwith the SEC as exhibits to reports previously filed by us. See “Where You Can Find More Information.” Limitations of Liability and\\nIndemnification of Officers and Directors Our amended and restated articles of incorporation, as amended, limit the liability of\\ndirectors and officers and provides that no director or officer of ours will be personally liable to us or any of our stockholders for damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director or officer involving any act or omission of any act by such\\ndirector or officer, other than (i)\\xa0for acts or omissions which involve intentional misconduct, fraud, or a known violation of the law, or (ii)\\xa0the payment of dividends in violation of Section\\xa078.300 of the NRS. In addition, our\\namended and restated articles of incorporation, as amended, provide that we will indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by law. We are a Nevada corporation and generally governed by the Nevada Private Corporations Code, Chapter 78 of the Nevada Revised Statutes, or NRS.\\nSection\\xa078.138 of the NRS provides that, unless the corporation’s articles of incorporation provide otherwise, a director or\\nofficer is not individually liable to the corporation or its stockholders or creditors for damages as a result of any action or omission to act as a director or officer unless the presumption that the director or officer acted in good faith, on an\\ninformed basis and with a view to the interests to the corporation is rebutted and it is proven that (i)\\xa0the director’s or officer’s acts or omissions constituted a breach of his or her fiduciary duties, and (ii)\\xa0such breach\\ninvolved intentional misconduct, fraud, or a knowing violation of the law. Section\\xa078.7502 of the NRS permits a company to indemnify\\nits directors and officers against expenses, judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred in connection with a threatened, pending, or completed action, suit, or proceeding, if the officer or director (i)\\xa0is\\nnot liable pursuant to Section\\xa078.138 of the NRS, or (ii)\\xa0acted in good faith and in a manner the officer or director reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and, if a criminal action or\\nproceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe the conduct of the officer or director was unlawful. A discretionary indemnification pursuant to Section\\xa078.7502 may be made as authorized in the specific case upon a determination by the\\nstockholders, the disinterested board members, or, under certain circumstances, by independent legal counsel. Indemnification under Section\\xa078.7502 of the NRS may not be made the corporation if the officer or director has been adjudged by a\\ncourt of competent jurisdiction, after exhaustion of any appeals, to be liable to the corporation or for amounts paid in settlement to the corporation, unless and only to the extent that the court determines that in view of all the circumstances,\\nthe person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses. Section\\xa078.751 of the NRS requires a corporation to\\nindemnify its officers and directors to the extent that they have been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding (whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative) or any claim, issue or matter\\ntherein, but also provides that discretionary indemnification may not be made under Section\\xa078.7502 of a director or officer finally adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction, after exhaustion of any appeals, to be liable for intentional\\nmisconduct, fraud or a knowing violation of law, and such misconduct, fraud or violation was material to the cause of action. Section\\xa078.751 of the NRS permits a Nevada corporation to indemnify its officers and directors against expenses incurred in defending a\\ncivil or criminal action, suit, or proceeding as they are incurred and in advance of final disposition thereof. Section\\xa078.751 of the NRS provides\\nthat, unless restricted by the articles of incorporation, the bylaws or an agreement made by the corporation, the corporation may (or shall, if required by \\nthe articles of incorporation, bylaws or an agreement) pay expenses as incurred and in advance of final disposition of the action, suit or proceeding, upon receipt of an undertaking by or on\\nbehalf of the officer or director to repay the amount if it is ultimately determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that such officer or director is not entitled to be indemnified by the corporation. Section\\xa078.751 of the NRS further\\npermits the corporation to grant its directors and officers additional rights of indemnification under its articles of incorporation, bylaws, or other agreement. We have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and executive\\nofficers. Section\\xa078.752 of the NRS provides that a Nevada corporation may purchase and maintain insurance or make other financial\\narrangements on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee, or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee, or agent of another company, partnership, joint\\nventure, trust, or other enterprise, for any liability asserted against him and liability and expenses incurred by him in his capacity as a director, officer, employee, or agent, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the corporation\\nhas the authority to indemnify him against such liability and expenses. We have obtained primary and excess insurance policies insuring our directors and officers and our subsidiaries against certain liabilities they may incur in their capacity as\\ndirectors and officers. Under such policies, the insurer, on our behalf, may also pay amounts for which we have granted indemnification to the directors or officers. The foregoing discussion of indemnification merely summarizes certain aspects of indemnification provisions and is limited by reference to the\\nabove discussed sections of the Nevada Private Corporations Code. Our amended and restated articles of incorporation, as amended, provide\\nthat we shall, to the fullest extent permitted by the provisions of the Nevada Private Corporations Code, indemnify any and all persons whom we have the power to indemnify from and against any and all expenses, liabilities and other matters referred\\nto in or covered by such provisions. Insofar as indemnification by our company for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to officers and directors of our company pursuant to the foregoing provisions or otherwise, we are aware\\nthat in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION We have entered into a Controlled Equity OfferingSM Sales Agreement, or the Sales\\nAgreement, with Cantor Fitzgerald\\xa0 Co., or Cantor Fitzgerald, under which we may offer and sell shares of our common stock. Pursuant to this prospectus supplement, we may offer and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate gross\\nsales price of up to $50,000,000 from time to time through Cantor Fitzgerald acting as agent. The Sales Agreement has been filed as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K. This summary of the material\\nprovisions of the Sales Agreement does not purport to be a complete statement of its terms and conditions. Upon delivery of a placement\\nnotice and subject to the terms and conditions of the Sales Agreement, Cantor Fitzgerald may offer and sell shares of our common stock by any method permitted by law deemed to be an “at the market offering” as defined in Rule 415(a)(4)\\npromulgated under the Securities Act, including sales made directly on Nasdaq or any other existing trading market for our common stock. We may instruct Cantor Fitzgerald not to sell common stock if the sales cannot be effected at or above the price\\ndesignated by us from time to time. We or Cantor Fitzgerald may suspend or terminate the offering of our common stock upon notice and subject to other conditions. We will pay Cantor Fitzgerald commissions, in cash, for its services in acting as agent in the sale of our common stock. Cantor Fitzgerald is\\nentitled to compensation at a commission rate of 3.0% of the gross proceeds from each sale of our common stock. Because there is no minimum offering amount required as a condition to this offering, the actual total public offering amount,\\ncommissions and proceeds to us, if any, are not determinable at this time. We have also agreed to reimburse a portion of Cantor Fitzgerald’s expenses, including legal fees, in connection with this offering up in an amount not to exceed $50,000.\\nA financial advisor will receive a cash fee in connection with this offering. The financial advisor is not acting as a sales agent and will not sell or offer to sell any securities and will not identify, solicit, or engage directly with potential\\ninvestors. In addition, the financial advisor will not underwrite or purchase any of the offered shares or otherwise participate in any such undertaking. We estimate that the total expenses for the offering under this prospectus supplement,\\nexcluding compensation and reimbursements payable to Cantor Fitzgerald under the terms of the Sales Agreement, will be approximately $1,130,000. Settlement for sales of shares of common stock will occur on the second business day following the date on which any sales are made, or on\\nsome other date that is agreed upon by us and Cantor Fitzgerald in connection with a particular transaction, in return for payment of the net proceeds to us. Sales of our common stock as contemplated in this prospectus supplement will be settled\\nthrough the facilities of The Depository Trust Company or by such other means as we and Cantor Fitzgerald may agree upon. There is no arrangement for funds to be received in an escrow, trust or similar arrangement. Cantor Fitzgerald will use its commercially reasonable efforts, consistent with its sales and trading practices and applicable law and\\nregulations, to solicit offers to purchase the shares of common stock under the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Sales Agreement. In connection with the sale of the shares of common stock on our behalf, Cantor Fitzgerald will be\\ndeemed to be an “underwriter” within the meaning of the Securities Act and the compensation of Cantor Fitzgerald will be deemed to be underwriting commissions or discounts. We have agreed to provide indemnification and contribution to\\nCantor Fitzgerald (and its partners, members, directors, officers, employees and agents) against certain civil liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. The offering of shares of our common stock pursuant to the Sales Agreement will terminate upon the termination of the Sales Agreement as\\npermitted therein. We and Cantor Fitzgerald may each terminate the Sales Agreement at any time upon five days’ prior notice. Cantor\\nFitzgerald and its affiliates may in the future provide various investment banking, commercial banking and other financial services for us, our subsidiaries and our affiliates, for which services they may in the future receive customary fees.

RISK FACTORS Investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the discussion\\nof risks and uncertainties under the heading “Risk Factors” contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December\\xa031, 2019, which is incorporated by reference in this\\nprospectus, and under similar headings in our subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and annual reports on Form 10-K, as well as the other risks and\\nuncertainties described in any applicable prospectus supplement or free writing prospectus and in the other documents incorporated by reference in this prospectus. See the sections entitled “Where You Can Find More Information” and\\n“Incorporation of Certain Information by Reference” in this prospectus. The risks and uncertainties we discuss in this prospectus, in any applicable prospectus supplement or free writing prospectus and in the other documents incorporated\\nby reference in this prospectus are not the only ones facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business, financial\\ncondition and results of operations. Please also refer to the section of this prospectus titled “Cautionary Statement About Forward Looking Statements.” Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Before investing in our common stock, you should consider carefully the risks described below and under the heading “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2020, as well as any amendment or update to our risk factors reflected in subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, which are incorporated by reference into this prospectus supplement, together with the other information contained in this prospectus supplement, the accompanying prospectus and in our other filings with the SEC that we have incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus. If any of these risks occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In these circumstances, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. Risks Related to this Offering Market Price of Common Stock There has been relatively limited trading volume in the market for our common stock, and there can be no assurance that a more active trading market for our shares of common stock will develop or be sustained after this offering. Securities of precious metal exploration companies have experienced substantial volatility in the past, often based on factors unrelated to the financial performance or prospects of the companies involved. These factors include macroeconomic developments in North America and globally, and market perceptions of the attractiveness of particular industries. The price of our securities is also likely to be significantly affected by short-term changes in commodity prices and specifically the price of gold and silver, other precious metal prices or other mineral prices, currency exchange fluctuation, or in our financial condition or results of operations as reflected in our quarterly earnings reports. Additionally, broad market fluctuations may cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities, securities class-action litigation has often been brought against that company. We may become involved in this type of litigation in the future. Litigation of this type may be expensive to defend and may divert our management’s attention and resources from the operation of our business. You may experience future dilution as a result of future equity offerings. In order to raise additional capital, we may in the future offer additional shares of common stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock at prices that may not be the same as the price per share in this offering. We may sell shares or other securities in any other offering at a price per share that is less than the price per share paid by investors in this offering, and investors purchasing shares or other securities in the future could have rights superior to existing stockholders. The price per share at which we sell additional shares of our common stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into common stock, in future transactions may be higher or lower than the price per share paid by investors in this offering. We have broad discretion in the use of our cash and cash equivalents, including the net proceeds we receive in this offering, and may not use them effectively. Our management has broad discretion to use our cash and cash equivalents, including the net proceeds we receive in this offering, to fund our operations and could spend these funds in ways that do not improve our results of operations or enhance the value of our common stock. The failure by our management to apply these funds effectively could result in financial losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, cause the price of our common stock to decline and delay the development of the Grassy Mountain Project. Pending their use to fund our operations, we may invest our cash and cash equivalents, including the net proceeds from this offering, in a manner that does not produce income or that loses value. Because we have no current plans to pay cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future, you may not receive any return on investment unless you sell your common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it. We intend to retain future earnings, if any, for future operations and expansion of our business and have no current plans to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. The declaration, amount and payment of any future dividends on shares of common stock will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors may take into account general and economic conditions, our financial condition, and results of operations, our available cash and current and anticipated cash needs, capital requirements, contractual, legal, tax and regulatory restrictions, implications on the payment of dividends by us to our stockholders or by our subsidiaries to us and such other factors as our Board of Directors may deem relevant. In addition, our ability to pay dividends is limited by covenants of our existing and outstanding indebtedness and may be limited by covenants of any future indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur. As a result, you may not receive any return on an investment in our common stock unless you sell our common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it. If securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they downgrade our stock or our sector, our stock price and trading volume could decline. The trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. We do not control these analysts. Furthermore, if one or more of the analysts who do cover us downgrades our stock or our industry, or the stock of any of our competitors, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our stock could decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of the Company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. \""
